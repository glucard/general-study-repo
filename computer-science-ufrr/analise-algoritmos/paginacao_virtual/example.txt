Is it possible to turn 
a sphere inside out? 


These arc )ust a few of the thought-provoking questions 
answered in this beautifullv illustrated book. Author 
Clifford A. Pit hover reveals the magic and mystery behind 
some of the most significant mathematical milestones as 
well as the oddest objects and ideas humanity has ever 
contemplated, beginning in 150 million B.C. and ending 
with the latest cuttmg-edge breakthroughs. 

Mathematics has permeated ever}* field of scientific 
endeavor. It can be used to explain the colors of the sun¬ 
set or the architecture of our brains, and help us explore 
subatomic quantum realities and image faraway galaxies. 

Notable formulas and mathematical concepts are 
accompanied by fascinating facts about mathematicians’ 
li\ cs and real-world, practical applications of theorems 
journey with Pickover as he traces 250 achievements 
like ancient ant “odometers,'' the first abacus, the discovers 
of computer-generated fractals, and the quest for new 
dimensions. Here also are remarkable thinkers from 
Pythagoras and Euclid to modern-dav math icon Martin 
Gardner and cosmologist Max Tegmark. 

Chronologically organized, each entry is short enough 
to digest in a few minutes and is presented along w ith a 
striking full-color image. 

“For me," writes Pickover, “mathematics cultivates a 
perpetual state of wonder about the nature of mind, the 
limits of thoughts, and our place in this vast cosmos.

“ Mathematics , rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but 
supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of 
sculpture” 

— Bertrand Russell, Mysticism and Logic , 1918 


“Mathematics is a wonderful, mad subject, full of imagination, 

fantasy, and creativity that is not limited by the petty details of 

the physical world, but only by the strength of our inner light.” 

—Gregory Chaitin, “Less Proof, More Truth,” 
New Scientist , July 28, 2007 


“Perhaps an angel of the Lord surveyed an endless sea of 
chaos, then troubled it gently with his finger. In this tiny and 
temporary swirl of equations, our cosmos took shape” 

—Martin Gardner, Order and Surprise, 1950 


“The great equations of modern physics are a permanent part of 
scientific knowledge, which may outlast even the beautiful 
cathedrals of earlier ages.”

Introduction 


The Beauty and Utility of Mathematics 


“An intelligent observer seeing mathematicians at work might 
conclude that they are devotees of exotic sects, pursuers of esoteric 
keys to the universe .” 

— Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh, The Mathematical Experience 

Mathematics has permeated every field of scientific endeavor and plays an invaluable role 
in biology, physics, chemistry, economics, sociology, and engineering. Mathematics can 
be used to help explain the colors of a sunset or the architecture of our brains. Mathematics 
helps us build supersonic aircraft and roller coasters, simulate the flow of Earth’s natural 
resources, explore subatomic quantum realities, and image faraway galaxies. Mathematics 
has changed the way we look at the cosmos. 

In this book, I hope to give readers a taste for mathematics using few formulas, while 
stretching and exercising the imagination. However, the topics in this book are not mere 
curiosities with little value to the average reader. In fact, reports from the U.S. Department 
of Education suggest that successfully completing a mathematics class in high school 
results in better performance at college whatever major the student chooses to pursue. 

The usefulness of mathematics allows us to build spaceships and investigate the 
geometry of our universe. Numbers may be our first means of communication with 
intelligent alien races. Some physicists have even speculated that an understanding of 
higher dimensions and of topology —the study of shapes and their interrelationships— 
may someday allow us to escape our universe, when it ends in either great heat or cold, 
and then we could call all of space-time our home. 

Simultaneous discovery has often occurred in the history of mathematics. As I mention 
in my book The Mobius Strip, in 1858 the German mathematician August Mobius (1790— 
1868) simultaneously and independently discovered the Mobius strip (a wonderful twisted 
object with just one side) along with a contemporary scholar, the German mathematician 
Johann Benedict Listing (1808-1882). This simultaneous discovery of the Mobius band 
by Mobius and Listing, just like that of calculus by English polymath Isaac Newton 
(1643-1727) and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), 


10 THE MATH BOOK 



makes me wonder why so many discoveries in science were made at the same time by 
people working independently. For another example, British naturalists Charles Darwin 
(1809-1882) and Alfred Wallace (1823-1913) both developed the theory of evolution 
independently and simultaneously. Similarly, Hungarian mathematician Janos Bolyai 
(1802-1860) and Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1793-1856) seemed to 
have developed hyperbolic geometry independently, and at the same time. 

Most likely, such simultaneous discoveries have occurred because the time was ripe 
for such discoveries, given humanity’s accumulated knowledge at the time the discoveries 
were made. Sometimes, two scientists are stimulated by reading the same preliminary 
research of one of their contemporaries. On the other hand, mystics have suggested that 
a deeper meaning exists to such coincidences. Austrian biologist Paul Kammerer (1880— 
1926) wrote, “We thus arrive at the image of a world-mosaic or cosmic kaleidoscope, 
which, in spite of constant shuffling and rearrangements, also takes care of bringing like 
and like together.” He compared events in our world to the tops of ocean waves that seem 
isolated and unrelated. According to his controversial theory, we notice the tops of the 
waves, but beneath the surface some kind of synchronistic mechanism may exist that 
mysteriously connects events in our world and causes them to cluster. 

Georges Ifrah in The Universal History of Numbers discusses simultaneity when 
writing about Mayan mathematics: 

We therefore see yet again how people who have been widely separated in time or 

space have... been led to very similar if not identical results_In some cases, the 

explanation for this may be found in contacts and influences between different 
groups of people.... The true explanation lies in what we have previously referred 
to as the profound unity of culture: the intelligence of Homo sapiens is universal 
and its potential is remarkably uniform in all parts of the world. 

Ancient people, like the Greeks, had a deep fascination with numbers. Could it be 
that in difficult times numbers were the only constant thing in an ever-shifting world? To 
the Pythagoreans, an ancient Greek sect, numbers were tangible, immutable, comfortable, 
eternal—more reliable than friends, less threatening than Apollo and Zeus. 

Many entries in this book deal with whole numbers, or integers. The brilliant mathe¬ 
matician Paul Erdos (1913-1996) was fascinated by number theory—the study of integers— 
and he had no trouble posing problems, using integers, that were often simple to state but 
notoriously difficult to solve. Erdos believed that if one can state a problem in mathematics 
that is unsolved for more than a century, then it is a problem in number theory. 


INTRODUCTION 11 




Many aspects of the universe can be expressed by whole numbers. Numerical patterns 
describe the arrangement of florets in a daisy, the reproduction of rabbits, the orbit of the 
planets, the harmonies of music, and the relationships between elements in the periodic 
table. Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891), a German algebraist and number theorist, once 
said, “The integers came from God and all else was man-made.” His implication was that 
the primary source of all mathematics is the integers. 

Since the time of Pythagoras, the role of integer ratios in musical scales has been 
widely appreciated. More important, integers have been crucial in the evolution of 
humanity’s scientific understanding. For example, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier 
(1743-1794) discovered that chemical compounds are composed of fixed proportions 
of elements corresponding to the ratios of small integers. This was very strong evidence 
for the existence of atoms. In 1925, certain integer relations between the wavelengths of 
spectral lines emitted by excited atoms gave early clues to the structure of atoms. The 
near-integer ratios of atomic weights were evidence that the atomic nucleus is made up 
of an integer number of similar nucleons (protons and neutrons). The deviations from 
integer ratios led to the discovery of elemental isotopes (variants with nearly identical 
chemical behavior but with different numbers of neutrons). 

Small divergences in the atomic masses of pure isotopes from exact integers 
confirmed Einstein’s famous equation E = me 2 and also the possibility of atomic bombs. 
Integers are everywhere in atomic physics. Integer relations are fundamental strands in 
the mathematical weave—or as German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777— 
1855) said, “Mathematics is the queen of sciences—and number theory is the queen of 
mathematics.” 

Our mathematical description of the universe grows forever, but our brains and language 
skills remain entrenched. New kinds of mathematics are being discovered or created all the 
time, but we need fresh ways to think and to understand. For example, in the last few years, 
mathematical proofs have been offered for famous problems in the history of mathematics, 
but the arguments have been far too long and complicated for experts to be certain they are 
correct. Mathematician Thomas Hales had to wait five years before expert reviewers of his 
geometry paper—submitted to the journal Annals of Mathematics— finally decided that 
they could find no errors and that the journal should publish Hales’s proof, but only with the 
disclaimer saying they were not certain it was right! Moreover, mathematicians like Keith 
Devlin have admitted in the New York Times that “the story of mathematics has reached a 
stage of such abstraction that many of its frontier problems cannot even be understood by 
the experts.” If experts have such trouble, one can easily see the challenge of conveying this 
kind of information to a general audience. We do the best we can. Mathematicians can 


12 THE MATH BOOK 




construct theories and perform computations, but they may not be sufficiently able to fully 
comprehend, explain, or communicate these ideas. 

A physics analogy is relevant here. When Werner Heisenberg worried that human 
beings might never truly understand atoms, Niels Bohr was a bit more optimistic. He 
replied in the early 1920s, “I think we may yet be able to do so, but in the process we 
may have to learn what the word understanding really means.” Today, we use computers 
to help us reason beyond the limitations of our own intuition. In fact, experiments with 
computers are leading mathematicians to discoveries and insights never dreamed of before 
the ubiquity of these devices. Computers and computer graphics allow mathematicians to 
discover results long before they can prove them formally and open entirely new fields of 
mathematics. Even simple computer tools like spreadsheets give modern mathematicians 
power that Gauss, Leonhard Euler, and Newton would have lusted after. As just one 
example, in the late 1990s, computer programs designed by David Bailey and Helaman 
Ferguson helped produce new formulas that related pi to log 5 and two other constants. As 
Erica Klarreich reports in Science News , once the computer had produced the formula, 
proving that it was correct was extremely easy. Often, simply knowing the answer is the 
largest hurdle to overcome when formulating a proof. 

Mathematical theories have sometimes been used to predict phenomena that were 
not confirmed until years later For example, Maxwell’s equations, named after physicist 
James Clerk Maxwell, predicted radio waves. Einstein’s field equations suggested that gravity 
would bend light and that the universe is expanding. Physicist Paul Dirac once noted that 
the abstract mathematics we study now gives us a glimpse of physics in the future. In fact, 
his equations predicted the existence of antimatter, which was subsequently discovered. 
Similarly, mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky said that “there is no branch of mathematics, 
however abstract, which may not someday be applied to the phenomena of the real world.” 

In this book, you will encounter various interesting geometries that have been thought 
to hold the keys to the universe. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) suggested that “Nature’s 
great book is written in mathematical symbols.” Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) modeled 
the solar system with Platonic solids such as the dodecahedron. In the 1960s, physicist 
Eugene Wigner (1902-1995) was impressed with the “unreasonable effectiveness of 
mathematics in the natural sciences.” Large Lie groups, like E 8 —which is discussed in 
the entry “The Quest for Lie Group Eg (2007)”—may someday help us create a unified 
theory of physics. In 2007, Swedish American cosmologist Max Tegmark published both 
scientific and popular articles on the mathematical universe hypothesis, which states that 
our physical reality is a mathematical structure —in other words, our universe is not just 
described by mathematics —it is mathematics. 


INTRODUCTION 13 




Book Organization and Purpose 


“At every major step, physics has required, and frequently stimulated, 
the introduction of new mathematical tools and concepts. Our 
present understanding of the laws of physics, with their extreme 
precision and universality, is only possible in mathematical terms ” 

— Sir Michael Atiyah, “Pulling the Strings,” Nature 

One common characteristic of mathematicians is a passion for completeness—an urge to 
return to first principles to explain their works. As a result, readers of mathematical texts 
must often wade through pages of background before getting to the essential findings. 
To avoid this problem, each entry in this book is short, at most only a few paragraphs in 
length. This format allows readers to jump right in to ponder a subject, without having to 
sort through a lot of verbiage. Want to know about infinity? Turn to the entries “Cantor’s 
Transfinite Numbers” (1874) or “Hilbert’s Grand Hotel” (1925), and you'll have a quick 
mental workout. Interested in the first commercially successful portable mechanical 
calculator, developed by a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp? Turn to “Curta 
Calculator” (1948) fora brief introduction. 

Wonder how an amusing-sounding theorem may oneday help scientists form nanowires 
for electronics devices? Then browse through the book and read the “Hairy Ball Theorem” 
(1912) entry. Why did the Nazis compel the president of the Polish Mathematical Society 
to feed his own blood to lice? Why was the first female mathematician murdered? Is it 
really possible to turn a sphere inside out? Who was the “Number Pope”? When did 
humans tie their first knots? Why don’t we use Roman numerals anymore? Who was the 
earliest named individual in the history of mathematics? Can a surface have only one 
side? We’ll tackle these and other thought-provoking questions in the pages that follow. 

Of course, my approach has some disadvantages. In just a few paragraphs, I can’t 
go into any depth on a subject. However, I provide suggestions for further reading in the 
“Notes and Further Reading” section. While I sometimes list primary sources, I have 
often explicitly listed excellent secondary references that readers can frequently obtain 
more easily than older primary sources. Readers interested in pursuing any subject can 
use the references as a useful starting point. 

My goal in writing The Math Book is to provide a wide audience with a brief guide 
to important mathematical ideas and thinkers, with entries short enough to digest in a 
few minutes. Most entries are ones that interested me personally. Alas, not all of the great 


14 THE MATH BOOK 





mathematical milestones are included in this book in order to prevent the book from 
growing too large. Thus, in celebrating the wonders of mathematics in this short volume, 
I have been forced to omit many important mathematical marvels. Nevertheless, I believe 
that I have included a majority of those with historical significance and that have had a 
strong influence on mathematics, society, or human thought. Some entries are eminently 
practical, involving topics that range from slide rules and other calculating devices to 
geodesic domes and the invention of zero. Occasionally, I include several lighter moments, 
which were nonetheless significant, such as the rise of the Rubik’s Cube puzzle or the 
solving of the Bed Sheet Problem. Sometimes, snippets of information are repeated so 
that each entry can be read on its own. Occasional text in boldface type points the reader 
to related entries. Additionally, a small “See also” section at the bottom of each entry helps 
weave entries together in a web of interconnectedness and may help the reader traverse 
the book in a playful quest for discovery. 

The Math Book reflects my own intellectual shortcomings, and while I try to study as 
many areas of science and mathematics as I can, it is difficult to become fluent in all aspects, 
and this book clearly indicates my own personal interests, strengths, and weaknesses. I 
am responsible for the choice of pivotal entries included in this book and, of course, 
for any errors and infelicities. This is not a comprehensive or scholarly dissertation, but 
rather it is intended as recreational reading for students of science and mathematics and 
interested laypeople. I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement from readers, 
as I consider this an ongoing project and a labor of love. 

This book is organized chronologically, according to the year of a mathematical 
milestone or finding. In some cases, the literature may report slightly different dates for the 
milestone because some sources give the publication date as the discovery date of a finding, 
while other sources give the actual date that a mathematical principle was discovered, 
regardless of the fact that the publication date is sometimes a year or more later. If I was 
uncertain of a precise earlier date of discovery, I often used the publication date. 

Dating of entries can also be a question of judgment when more than one individual 
made a contribution. Often, I have used the earliest date where appropriate, but sometimes 
I have surveyed colleagues and decided to use the date when a concept gamed particular 
prominence. For example, consider the Gray code, which is used to facilitate error 
correction in digital communications, such as in TV signal transmission, and to make 
transmission systems less susceptible to noise. This code was named after Frank Gray, a 
physicist at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1950s and 1960s. During this time, these 
kinds of codes gained particular prominence, partly due to his patent filed in 1947 and the 
rise of modern communications. The Gray code entry is thus dated as 1947, although it 


INTRODUCTION 15 




might also have been dated much earlier, because the roots of the idea go back to Emile 
Baudot (1845-1903), the French pioneer of the telegraph. In any case, I have attempted 
to give readers a feel for the span of possible dates in each entry or in the “Notes and 
Further Reading” section. 

Scholars sometimes have disputes with respect to the person to whom a discovery is 
traditionally attributed. For example, author Heinrich Dorrie cites four scholars who do not 
believe that a particular version of Archimedes' cattle problem is due to Archimedes, but 
he also cites four authors who believe that the problem should be attributed to Archimedes. 
Scholars also dispute the authorship of Aristotle’s wheel paradox. Where possible, I mention 
such disputes either in the main text or the “Notes and Further Reading” section. 

You will notice that a significant number of milestones have been achieved in just 
the last few decades. As just one example, in 2007, researchers finally “solved” the game 
of checkers, proving that if an opponent plays perfecdy, the game ends in draw. As already 
mentioned, part of the rapid recent progress in mathematics is due to the use of the 
computer as a tool for mathematical experiments. For the checkers solution, the analysis 
actually began in 1989 and required dozens of computers for the complete solution. The 
game has roughly 500 billion billion possible positions. 

Sometimes, science reporters or famous researchers are quoted in the main entries, 
but purely for brevity I don’t list the source of the quote or the author’s full credentials 
in the entry. I apologize in advance for this occasional compact approach; however, 
references in the back of the book should help to make the author's identity clearer. 

Even the naming of a theorem can be a tricky business. For example, mathematician 
Keith Devlin writes in his 2005 column for the Mathematical Association of America: 

Most mathematicians prove many theorems in their lives, and the process whereby 
their name gets attached to one of them is very haphazard. For instance, Euler, 
Gauss, and Fermat each proved hundreds of theorems, many of them important 
ones, and yet their names are attached to just a few of them. Sometimes theorems 
acquire names that are incorrect. Most famously, perhaps, Fermat almost certainly 
did not prove “Fermat’s Last Theorem”; rather, that name was attached by someone 
else, after his death, to a conjecture the French mathematician had scribbled in the 
margin of a textbook. And Pythagoras's theorem was known long before Pythagoras 
came onto the scene. 

In closing, let us note that mathematical discoveries provide a framework in which to 
explore the nature of reality, and mathematical tools allow scientists to make predictions 


16 THE MATH BOOK 




about the universe; thus, the discoveries in this book are among humanity’s greatest 
achievements. 

At first glance, this book may seem like a long catalogue of isolated concepts and 
people with little connection between them. But as you read, I think you’ll begin to see 
many linkages. Obviously, the final goal of scientists and mathematicians is not simply the 
accumulation of facts and lists of formulas, but rather they seek to understand the patterns, 
organizing principles, and relationships between these facts to form theorems and entirely 
new branches of human thought For me, mathematics cultivates a perpetual state of wonder 
about the nature of mind, the limits of thoughts, and our place in this vast cosmos. 

Our brains, which evolved to make us run from lions on the African savanna, may not 
be constructed to penetrate the infinite veil of reality. We may need mathematics, science, 
computers, brain augmentation, and even literature, art, and poetry to help us tear away 
the veils. For those of you who are about to embark on reading the The Math Book from 
cover to cover, look for the connections, gaze in awe at the evolution of ideas, and sail on 
the shoreless sea of imagination.

INTRODUCTION 17 



Ant Odometer 


Ants are social insects that evolved from vespoid wasps in the mid-Cretaceous period, 
about 150 million years ago. After the rise of flowering plants, about 100 million years 
ago, ants diversified into numerous species. 

The Saharan desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis, travels immense distances over 
sandy terrain, often completely devoid of landmarks, as it searches for food. These 
creatures are able to return to their nest using a direct route rather than by retracing 
their outbound path. Not only do they judge directions, using light from the sky for 
orientation, but they also appear to have a built-in "computer” that functions like a 
pedometer that counts their steps and allows them to measure exact distances. An 
ant may travel as far as 160 feet (about 50 meters) until it encounters a dead insect, 
whereupon it tears a piece to cany directly back to its nest, accessed via a hole often less 
than a millimeter in diameter. 

By manipulating the leg lengths of ants to give them longer and shorter strides, a 
research team of German and Swiss scientists discovered that the ants "count” steps 
to judge distance. For example, after ants had reached their destination, the legs were 
lengthened by adding stilts or shortened by partial amputation. The researchers then 
returned the ants so that the ants could start on their journey back to the nest. Ants with 
the stilts traveled too far and passed the nest entrance, while those with the amputated 
legs did not reach it However, if the ants started their journey from their nest with the 
modified legs, they were able to compute the appropriate distances. This suggests that 
stride length is the crucial factor. Moreover, the highly sophisticated computer in the 
ant's brain enables the ant to compute a quantity related to the horizontal projection of 
its path so that it does not become lost even if the sandy landscape develops hills and 
valleys during its journey.

Saharan desert ants may have built-in “pedometers" that count steps and allow the ants to measure exact 
distances. Ants with stilts glued to their leg/s (shown in red) travel too far and pass their nest entrance, suggesting 
that stride length is important for distance determination. 











Primates Count 


Around 60 million years ago, small, lemur-like primates had evolved in many areas 
of the world, and 30 million years ago, primates with monkeylike characteristics 
existed. Could such creatures count? The meaning of counting by animals is a highly 
contentious issue among animal behavior experts. However, many scholars suggest that 
animals have some sense of number. H. Kalmus writes in his Nature article “Animals as 
Mathematicians”: 

There is now little doubt that some animals such as squirrels or parrots can be 

trained to count_Counting faculties have been reported in squirrels, rats, and 

for pollinating insects. Some of these animals and others can distinguish numbers 
in otherwise similar visual patterns, while others can be trained to recognize and 
even to reproduce sequences of acoustic signals. A few can even be trained to tap 
out the numbers of elements (dots) in a visual pattern... .The lack of the spoken 
numeral and the written symbol makes many people reluctant to accept animals 
as mathematicians. 

Rats have been shown to “count” by performing an activity the correct number of times 
in exchange for a reward. Chimpanzees can press numbers on a computer that match 
numbers of bananas in a box. Testsuro Matsuzawa of the Primate Research Institute 
at Kyoto University in lapan taught a chimpanzee to identify numbers from 1 to 6 by 
pressing the appropriate computer key when she was shown a certain number of objects 
on the computer screen. 

Michael Beran, a research scientist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia, 
trained chimps to use a computer screen and joystick. The screen flashed a numeral 
and then a series of dots, and the chimps had to match the two. One chimp learned 
numerals 1 to 7, while another managed to count to 6. When the chimps were tested 
again after a gap of three years, both chimps were able to match numbers, but with 
double the error rate.

J to 6 by pressing the appropriate computer key when shown a certain number of objects. 













Cicada-Generated Prime Numbers 


Cicadas are winged insects that evolved, around 1.8 milli on years ago during the 
Pleistocene epoch, when glaciers advanced and retreated across North America- Cicadas 
of the genus Magicicada spend most of their lives below the ground, feeding on the 
juices of plant roots, and then emerge, mate, and die quickly. These creatures display a 
startling behavior: Their emergence is synchronized with periods of years that are usually 
the prime numbers 13 and 17. (A prime number is an integer such as 11,13, and 17 
that has only two integer divisors: 1 and itself.) During the spring of their 13th or 17th 
year, these periodical cicadas construct an exit tunnel. Sometimes more than 1.5 million 
individuals emerge in a single acre; this abundance of bodies may have survival value as 
they overwhelm predators such as birds that cannot possibly eat them all at once. 

Some researchers have speculated that the evolution of prime-number life cycles 
occurred so that the creatures increased their chances of evading shorter-lived predators 
and parasites. For example, if these cicadas had 12-year life cycles, all predators with life 
cycles of 2, 3,4, or 6 years might more easily find the insects. Mario Markus of the Max 
Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology in Dortmund, Germany, and his coworkers 
discovered that these kinds of prime-number cycles arise naturally from evolutionary 
mathematical models of interactions between predator and prey. In order to experiment, 
they first assigned random life-cycle durations to their computer-simulated populations. 
After some time, a sequence of mutations always locked the synthetic cicadas into a 
stable prime-number cycle. 

Of course, this research is still in its infancy and many questions remain. What is 
special about 13 and 17? What predators or parasites have actually existed to drive the 
cicadas to these periods? Also, a mystery remains as to why, of the 1,500 cicada species 
worldwide, only a small number of the genus Magicicada are known to be periodical.

are usually the prune numbers i 3 and 17. Sometimes more than l 5 million individuals emerge in a single acre 
within a short interval of time 














Knots 


The use of knots may predate modem humans {Homo sapiens). For example, seashells 
colored with ocher, pierced with holes, and dated to 82,000 years ago have been 
discovered in a Moroccan cave. Other archeological evidence suggests much older bead 
use in humans. The piercing implies the use of cords and the use of a knot to hold the 
objects to a loop, such as a necklace. 

The quintessence of ornamental knots is exemplified by The Book ofKelk, an 
ornately illustrated Gospel Bible, produced by Celtic monks in about A.D. 800. In 
modem times, the study of knots, such as the trefoil knot with three crossings, is part 
of a vast branch of mathematics dealing with closed twisted loops. In 1914, German 
mathematician Max Dehn (1878—1952) showed that the trefoil knot’s mirror images are 
not equivalent 

For centuries, mathematicians have tried to develop ways to distinguish tangles 
that look like knots (called unknots ) from true knots and to distinguish true knots from 
one another. Over the years, mathematicians have created seemingly endless tables 
of distinct knots. So far, more than 1.7 million nonequivalent knots with pictures 
containing 16 or fewer crossings have been identified. 

Entire conferences are devoted to knots today. Scientists study knots in fields 
ranging from molecular genetics—to help us understand how to unravel a loop of 
DNA—to particle physics, in an attempt to represent the fundamental nature of 
elementary particles. 

Knots have been crucial to the development of civilization, where they have been 
used to tie clothing, to secure weapons to the body, to create shelters, and to permit the 
sailing of ships and world exploration. Today, knot theory in mathematics has become 
so advanced that mere mortals find it challenging to understand its most profound 
applications. In a few millennia, humans have transformed knots from simple necklace 
ties to models of the very fabric of reality.

Ishango Bone 


In 1960, Belgian geologist and explorer Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt (1920—1998) 
discovered a baboon bone with markings in what is today the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. The Ishango bone, with its sequence of notches, was first thought to be a 
simple tally stick used by a Stone Age African. However, according to some scientists, 
the marks suggest a mathematical prowess that goes beyond counting of objects. 

The bone was found in Ishango, near the headwaters of the Nile River, the home 
of a large population of upper Paleolithic people prior to a volcanic eruption that buried 
the area. One column of marks on the bone begins with three notches that double to 
six notches. Four notches double to eight. Ten notches halve to five. This may suggest 
a simple understanding of doubling or halving. Even more striking is the fact that 
numbers in other columns are all odd (9,11,13,17, 19, and 21). One column contains 
the prime numbers between 10 and 20, and the numbers in each column sum to 60 or 
48, both multiples of 12. 

A number of tally sticks have been discovered that predate the Ishango bone. For 
example, the Swaziland Lebombo bone is a 37,000-year-old baboon fibula with 29 
notches. A 32,000-year-old wolf tibia with 57 notches, grouped in fives, was found 
in Czechoslovakia. Although quite speculative, some have hypothesized that the 
markings on the Ishango bone form a kind of lunar calendar for a Stone Age woman 
who kept track of her menstrual cycles, giving rise to the slogan “menstruation created 
mathematics" Even if the Ishango was a simple bookkeeping device, these tallies seem 
to set us apart from the animals and represent the first steps to symbolic mathematics. 
The full mystery of the Ishango bone can't be solved until other similar bones are 
discovered.

Quipu 


The ancient Incas used quipus (pronounced “key^poos”), memory banks made of strings 
and knots, for storing numbers. Until recently, the oldest-known quipus dated from 
about A.D. 650. However, in 2005, a quipu from the Peruvian coastal city of Caral was 
dated to about 5,000 years ago. 

The Incas of South America had a complex civilization with a common state 
religion and a common language. Although they did not have writing, they kept 
extensive records encoded by a logical-numerical system on the quipus, which varied 
in complexity from three to around a thousand cords. Unfortunately, when the Spanish 
came to South America, they saw the strange quipus and thought they were the works 
of the Devil. The Spanish destroyed thousands of them in the name of God, and today 
only about 600 quipus remain. 

Knot types and positions, cord directions, cord levels, and color and spacing 
represent numbers mapped to real-world objects. Different knot groups were used for 
different powers of 10. The knots were probably used to record human and material 
resources and calendar information. The quipus may have contained more information 
such as construction plans, dance patterns, and even aspects of Inca history. The quipu 
is significant because it dispels the notion that mathematics flourishes only after a 
civilization has developed writing; however, societies can reach advanced states without 
ever having developed written records. Interestingly, today there are computer systems 
whose file managers are called quipus, in honor of this very useful ancient device. 

One sinister application of the quipu by the Incas was as a death calculator. Yearly 
quotas of adults and children were ritually slaughtered, and this enterprise was planned 
using a quipu. Some quipus represented the empire, and the cords referred to roads and 
the knots to sacrificial victims.

directions, cord levels , and colors often represented dates and counts of people and objects. 















Dice 


Imagine a world without random numbers. In the 1940s, the generation of statistically 
random numbers was important to physicists simulating thermonuclear explosions, and 
today, many computer networks employ random numbers to help route Internet traffic 
to avoid congestion. Political poll-takers use random numbers to select unbiased samples 
of potential voters. 

Dice, originally made from the anklebones of hoofed animals, were one of the 
earliest means for producing random numbers. In ancient civilizations, the gods were 
believed to control the outcome of dice tosses; thus, dice were relied upon to make 
crucial decisions, ranging from the selection of rulers to the division of property in 
an inheritance. Even today, the metaphor of God controlling dice is common, as 
evidenced by astrophysicist Stephen Hawking’s quote, “Not only does God play dice, 
but He sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can’t be seen.” 

The oldest-known dice were excavated together with a 5,000-year-old backgammon 
set from the legendary Burnt City in southeastern Iran. The city represents four stages 
of civilization that were destroyed by fires before being abandoned in 2100 B.C. At this 
same site, archeologists also discovered the earliest-known artificial eye, which once 
stared out hypnotically from the face of an ancient female priestess or soothsayer. 

For centuries, dice rolls have been used to teach probability. For a single roll of an 
n-sided die with a different number on each face, the probability of rolling any value is 
1/n. The probability of rolling a particular sequence of i numbers is 1/n 1 . For example, 
the chance of rolling a 1 followed by a 4 on a traditional die is 1/6 2 = 1/36. Using two 
traditional dice, the probability of throwing any given sum is the number of ways to 
throw that sum divided by the total number of combinations, which is why a sum of 
7 is much more likely than a sum of 2.

Dice were originally made from the anklebones of animals and were among the earliest means for producing 
random numbers. In ancient civilizations 1 people used dice to predict the future , believing that the gods 
influenced dice outcomes 














Magic Squares 

Bernard Frdnicle de Bessy (1602-1675) 

Legends suggest that magic squares originated in China and were first mentioned in a 
manuscript from the time of Emperor Yu, around 2200 B.C. A magic square consists of 
N 2 boxes, called cells, filled with integers that are all different The sums of the numbers 
in the horizontal rows, vertical columns, and main diagonals are all equal. 

If the integers in a magic square are tire consecutive numbers from 1 to N 2 , the 
square is said to be of the Nth order, and the magic number, or sum of each row, is a 
constant equal to N(N 2 + l)/2. Renaissance artist Albrecht Diirer created this wonderful 
4x4 magic square below in 1514. 

Note the two central numbers in the bottom row read 
“1514,” the year of its construction. The rows, columns, and 
main diagonals sum to 34. In addition, 34 is the sum of the 
numbers of the comer squares (16+13 + 4+1) and of the 
central 2x2 square (10+11+6 + 7). 

As far back as 1693, the 880 different fourth-order magic 
squares were published posthumously in Des quassez ou tables 
magiques by Bernard Frdnicle de Bessy, an eminent amateur 
French mathematician and one of the leading magic square researchers of all time. 

We’ve come a long way from the simplest 3x3 magic squares venerated by 
civilizations of almost every period and continent, from the Mayan Indians to the Hasua 
people of Africa. Today, mathematicians study these magic objects in high dimensions— 
for example, in the form of four-dimensional hypercubes that have magic sums within 
all appropriate directions.

The Sagrada Faimlia church in Barcelona, Spain, features a 4 x 4 magic square with a magic constant of 33, 
the age at which Jesus died according to many biblical interpretations. Note that this is not a traditional magic 
square because some numbers are repeated.

Plimpton 322 

George Arthur Plimpton (1855-1936) 


Plimpton 322 refers to a mysterious Babylonian clay tablet featuring numbers in cunei¬ 
form script in a table of 4 columns and 15 rows. Eleanor Robson, a historian of science, 
refers to it as “one of the world’s most famous mathematical artifacts.” Written around 
1800 B.C., the table lists Pythagorean triples—that is, whole numbers that specify the 
side lengths of right triangles that are solutions to the Pythagorean theorem d 2 + fc 2 = c 2 . 
For example, the numbers 3,4, and 5 are a Pythagorean triple. The fourth column in 
the table simply contains the row number. Interpretations vary as to the precise meaning 
of the numbers in the table, with some scholars suggesting that the numbers were 
solutions for students studying algebra or trigonometry-like problems. 

Plimpton 322 is named after New York publisher George Plimpton who, in 1922, 
bought the tablet for $10 from a dealer and then donated the tablet to Columbia 
University. The tablet can be traced to the Old Babylonian civilization that flourished 
in Mesopotamia, the fertile valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which is now 
located in Iraq. To put the era into perspective, the unknown scribe who generated 
Plimpton 322 lived within about a century of King Hammurabi, famous for his set of 
laws that included “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth ” According to biblical history, 
Abraham, who is said to have led his people west from the city of Ur on the bank of the 
Euphrates into Canaan, would have been another near contemporary of the scribe. 

The Babylonians wrote on wet clay by pressing a stylus or wedge into the clay. In 
the Babylonian number system, the number 1 was written with a single stroke and the 
numbers 2 through 9 were written by combining multiples of a single stroke.

Rhind Papyrus 

Ahmes (c. 1680 B.C.-c. 1620 B.C.), Alexander Henry Rhind (1833-1863) 


The Rhind Papyrus is considered to be the most important known source of information 
concerning ancient Egyptian mathematics. This scroll, about a foot (30 centimeters) 
high and 18 feet (5-5 meters) long, was found in a tomb in Thebes on the east bank of 
the river Nile. Ahmes, the scribe, wrote it in hieratic, a script related to the hieroglyphic 
system. Given that the writing occurred in around 1650 B.C., this makes Ahmes the 
earliest-named individual in the history of mathematics! The scroll also contains the 
earliest-known symbols for mathematical operations— plu s is denoted by a pair of legs 
walking toward the number to be added. 

In 1858, Scottish lawyer and Egyptologist Alexander Henry Rhind had been visiting 
Egypt for health reasons when he bought the scroll in a market in Luxor. The British 
Museum in London acquired the scroll in 1864. 

Ahmes wrote that the scroll gives an “accurate reckoning for inquiring into 
things, and the knowledge of all things, mysteries... all secrets.” The content of the 
scroll concerns mathematical problems involving fractions, arithmetic progressions, 
algebra, and pyramid geometry, as well as practical mathematics useful for surveying, 
building, and accounting. The problem that intrigues me the most is Problem 79, the 
interpretation of which was initially baffling. 

Today, many interpret Problem 79 as a puzzle, which may be translated as “Seven 
houses contain seven cats. Each cat kills seven mice. Each mouse had eaten seven 
ears of grain. Each ear of grain would have produced seven hekats (measures) of 
wheat. What is the total of all of these?” Interestingly, this indestructible puzzle meme, 
involving the number 7 and animals, seems to have persisted through thousands 
of years! We observe something quite similar in Fibonacci’s Liber Abaci (Booh of 
Calculation), published in 1202, and later in tire St. Ives puzzle, an Old English 
children s rhyme involving 7 cats.

The game of Tic Tac Toe (TTT) is a among humanity's best-known and most ancient 
games. Although the precise date of TTT with its modem rules maybe relatively recent, 
archeologists can trace what appear to be "three-in-a-row games” to ancient Egypt around 
1300 B.C., and I suspect that similar kinds of games originated at the very dawn of human 
societies. For TTT, two players, O and X, take turns marking their symbols in the spaces 
of a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first places three of his own marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal row wins. A draw can always be obtained for the 3x3 board. 

In ancient Egypt, during the time of the great pharaohs, board games played an 
important role in everyday life, and TTT-like games are known to have been played 
during these ancient days. TTT may be considered an "atom” upon which the 
molecules of more advanced games of position were built through the centuries. With 
the slightest of variations and extensions, the simple game of TTT becomes a fantastic 
challenge requiring significant time to master. 

Mathematicians and puzzle aficionados have extended TTT to larger boards, higher 
dimensions, and strange playing surfaces such as rectangular or square boards that are 
connected at their edges to form a torus (doughnut shape) or Klein bottle (a surface with 
just one side). 

Consider some TTT curiosities. Players can place their Xs and Os on the TTT board 
in 9! = 362,880 ways- There are 255,168 possible games in TTT when considering all 
possible games that end in 5, 6,7, 8, and 9 moves. In the early 1980s, computer geniuses 
Danny Hillis, Brian Silverman, and friends built a Tlnkertoy® computer that played TTT. 
The device was made from 10,000 Tinkertoy parts. In 1998, researchers and students 
at the University of Toronto created a robot to play three-dimensional (4x4x4) 

TTT with a human.

Pythagorean Theorem and Triangles 

Baudhayana (c. 800 B.C.), Pythagoras of Samos (c. 580 B.C.-c. 500 B.C.) 

Today, young children sometimes first hear of the humous Pythagorean theorem from the 
mouth of the Scarecrow, when he finally gets a brain in MGM’s 1939 film version of The 
Wizard of Oz. Alas, the Scarecrow’s recitation of the famous theorem is completely wrong! 

The Pythagorean theorem states that for any right triangle, the square of the 
hypotenuse length c is equal to the sum of the squares on the two (shorter) “leg” lengths 
a and b— which is written as a 1 + b 1 = c 2 . The theorem has more published proofs than 
any other, and Elisha Scott Loomis’s book Pythagorean Proposition contains 367 proofs. 

Pythagorean triangles (PTs) are right triangles with integer sides. The “3-4-5” PT— 
with legs of lengths 3 and 4, and a hypotenuse of length 5—is the only PT with three 
sides as consecutive numbers and the only triangle with integer sides, the sum of whose 
sides (12) is equal to double its area (6). After the 3-4-5 PT, the next triangle with 
consecutive leg lengths is 21-20-29. The tenth such triangle is much larger: 27304197- 
27304196-38613965. 

In 1643, French mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) asked for a PT, such 
that both the hypotenuse c and the sum (a + b) had values that were square numbers. 

It was startling to find that the smallest three numbers satisfying these conditions are 
4,565,486,027,761, 1,061,652,293,520, and 4,687,298,610,289. It turns out that the 
second such triangle would be so “large” that if its numbers were represented as feet, the 
triangle’s legs would project from Earth to beyond the sun! 

Although Pythagoras is often credited with the formulation of the Pythagorean 
theorem, evidence suggests that the theorem was developed by the Hindu mathematician 
Baudhayana centuries earlier around 800 B.C. in his book Baudhayana Sulba Sutra. 
Pythagorean triangles were probably known even earlier to the Babylonians.

Persian mathematician blast al-Din al-Tusi (1201—1274) presented a version of Euclid’s proof of the 
Pythagorean theorem. Al-Tusi was a prolific mathematician, astronomer, biologist, chemist, philosopher, 
physician, and theologian. 







Go 


Go is a two-player board game that originated in China around 2000 B.C. The earliest 
written references to the game are from the earliest Chinese work of narrative history, 
Zuo Z huan (Chronicle of7.uo), which describes a man in 548 B.C. who played the 
game. The game spread to Japan, where it became popular in the thirteenth century. 
Two players alternately place black and white stones on intersections of a 19 x 19 
playing board. A stone or a group of stones is captured and removed if it is tightly 
surrounded by stones of the opposing color. The objective is to control a larger territory 
than ones opponent. 

Go is complex for many reasons, including its large game board, multifaceted 
strategies, and huge numbers of variations in possible games. Simply having more stones 
than an opponent does not ensure victory. After taking symmetry into account, there 
are 32,940 opening moves, of which 992 are considered to be strong ones. The number 
of possible board configurations is usually estimated to be on the order of 10 177 , with 
about 10 768 possible games. Typical games between talented players consist of about 150 
moves, with an average of about 250 choices per move. While powerful chess software 
is capable of defeating top chess players, the best Go programs often lose to skillful 
children. 

Go-playing computers find it difficult to "look ahead” in the game to judge 
outcomes because many more reasonable moves must be considered in Go than in 
chess. The process of evaluating the favorability of a position is also quite difficult 
because a difference of a single unoccupied grid point can affect large groups of stones. 

In 2006, two Hungarian researchers reported that an algorithm called UCT (for 
Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees) could compete with professional Go 
players, but only on 9 x 9 boards. UCT helps the computer focus its search on the most 
promising moves.

The gome of Go is complex, due in part to the large game board, complicated strategies , and huge numbers of 
variations in possible games. While powerful chess software is capable of defeating top chess players, the best Go 
programs often lose to skillful children. 




















Pythagoras Founds Mathematical 
Brotherhood 


Pythagoras of Samos (c. 580 B.C.-c. 500 B.C.) 


Around 530 B.C., the Greek mathematician Pythagoras moved to Croton, Italy, to teach 
mathematics, music, and reincarnation. Although many of Pythagoras's accomplishments 
may actually have been due to his disciples, the ideas of his brotherhood influenced both 
numerology and mathematics for centuries. Pythagoras is usually credited with discovering 
mathematical relationships relevant to musical harmonies. For example, he observed that 
vibrating strings produce harmonious sounds when the ratios of the lengths of the strings 
are whole numbers. He also studied triangular numbers (based on patterns of dots in a 
triangular shape) and perfect numbers (integers that are the sum of their proper positive 
divisors). Although the famous theorem that bears his name, u 2 + £> 2 = c 2 for a right 
triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, may have been known to the Indians and 
Babylonians much earlier, some scholars have suggested that Pythagoras or his students 
were among the first Greeks to prove it. 

To Pythagoras and his followers, numbers were like gods, pure and free from 
material change. Worship of the numbers 1 through 10 was a kind of polytheism for 
the Pythagoreans. They believed that numbers were alive, with a telepathic form of 
consciousness. Humans could relinquish their three-dimensional lives and telepathize 
with these number beings by using various forms of meditation. 

Some of these seemingly odd ideas are not foreign to modern mathematicians who 
often debate whether mathematics is a creation of the human mind or if it is simply a 
part of the universe, independent of human thought. To the Pythagoreans, mathematics 
was an ecstatic revelation. Mathematical and theological blending flourished under 
the Pythagoreans and eventually affected much of the religious philosophy in Greece, 
played a role in religion of the Middle Ages, and extended to philosopher Immanuel 
Kant in modern times. Bertrand Russell mused that if it were not for Pythagoras, 
theologians would not have so frequently sought logical proofs of God and immortality.

Zeno’s Paradoxes 


Zeno of Elea (c. 490 B.C.-c. 430 B.C.) 

For more than a thousand years, philosophers and mathematicians have tried to understand 
Zeno’s paradoxes, a set of riddles that suggest that motion should be impossible or that it 
is an illusion. Zeno was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from southern Italy. His most 
famous paradox involves the Greek hero Achilles and a slow tortoise that Achilles can 
never overtake during a race once the tortoise is given a head start. In fact, the paradox 
seems to imply that you can never leave the room you are in. In order to reach the door, 
you must first travel half the distance there. You'll also need to continue to half the 
remaining distance, and half again, and so on. You won't reach the door in a finite number 
of jumps! Mathematically one can represent this limit of an infinite sequence of actions as 
the sum of the series (1/2 + 1/4 4-1/8 + ...). One modem tendency is to attempt to resolve 
Zenos paradox by insisting that the sum of this infinite series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 is equal to 1. 
If each step is done in half as much time, the actual time to complete the infinite series is 
no different than the real time required to leave the room. 

However, this approach may not provide a satisfying resolution because it does 
not explain how one is able to finish going through an infinite number of points, one 
after the other. Today, mathematicians make use of infinitesimals (unimaginably tiny 
quantities that are almost but not quite zero) to provide a microscopic analysis of the 
paradox. Coupled with a branch of mathematics called nonstandard analysis and, in 
particular, internal set theory, we may have resolved tire paradox, but debate continues. 
Some have also argued that if space and time are discrete, the total number of jumps in 
going from one point to another must be finite.

According to Zeno's most famous paradox , the rabbit can never overtake the tortoise once the tortoise is given a

Quadrature of the Lune 

Hippocrates of Chios (c. 470 B.C.-c. 400 B.C.) 


Ancient Greek mathematicians were enchanted by the beauty, symmetry, and order 
of geometry. Succumbing to this passion, Greek mathematician Hippocrates of Chios 
demonstrated how to construct a square with an area equal to a particular lune. A lune 
is a crescent-shaped area, bounded by two concave circular arcs, and this Quadrature of 
the Lune is one of the earliest-known proofs in mathematics. In other words, Hippocrates 
demonstrated that the area of these lunes could be expressed exactly as a rectilinear 
area, or ''quadrature” In the example depicted here, two yellow lunes associated with the 
sides of a right triangle have a combined area equal to that of the triangle. 

For the ancient Greeks, finding the quadrature meant using a straightedge and 
compass to construct a square equal in area to a given shape. If such a construction 
is possible, the shape is said to be "quadrable” (or "squareable”). The Greeks had 
accomplished the quadrature of polygons, but curved forms were more difficult In fact, 
it must have seemed unlikely, at first, that curved objects could be quadrable at all. 

Hippocrates is also famous for compiling the first-known organized work on 
geometry, nearly a century before Euclid. Euclid may have used some of Hippocrates’ 
ideas in his own work, Elements. Hippocrates’ writings were significant because they 
provided a common framework upon which other mathematicians could build. 

Hippocrates’ lune quest was actually part of a research effort to achieve the 
“quadrature of the circle”—that is, to construct a square with the same area as a circle. 
Mathematicians had tried to solve the problem of “squaring the circle” for more than 
2,000 years, until Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882 proved that it is impossible. 

Today, we know that only five types of lune exist that are quadrable. Three of these were 
discovered by Hippocrates, and two more kinds were found in the mid-1770s. 

SEE ALSO Pythagorean Theorem and Triangles (c 600 B C.), Euclid’s Elements (300 B.C.), Descartes' La 
Gfam&rie (1637), and Transcendental Numbers (18+4).

The two lunes (the yellow crescent-shaped areas) associated with the sides of a right triangle have a combined 
area equal to that of the triangle. Ancient Greek mathematicians were enchanted by the elegance of these kinds 
of geometrical findings. 






Platonic Solids 


Plato (c. 428 B.C.-c. 348 B.C.) 

A Platonic solid is a convex multifaceted 3-D object whose faces are all identical 
polygons, with sides of equal length and angles of equal degrees. A Platonic solid also 
has the same number of faces meeting at every vertex. The best-known example of a 
Platonic solid is the cube, whose feces are six identical squares. 

The ancient Greeks recognized and proved that only five Platonic solids can be 
constructed: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. For 
example, die icosahedron has 20 feces, all in the shape of equilateral triangles. 

Plato described the five Platonic solids in Timaeus in around 350 B.C. He was 
not only awestruck by their beauty and symmetry, but he also believed that the shapes 
described the structures of the four basic elements thought to compose the cosmos. In 
particular, the tetrahedron was the shape that represented fire, perhaps because of the 
polyhedron’s sharp edges. The octahedron was air. Water was made up of icosahedra, 
which are smoother than the other Platonic solids. Earth consisted of cubes, which 
look sturdy and solid. Plato decided that God used the dodecahedron for arranging the 
constellations in the heavens. 

Pythagoras of Samos—die famous mathematician and mystic who lived in the 
time of Buddha and Confucius, around 5 50 B.C.—probably knew of three of the five 
Platonic solids (the cube, tetrahedron, and dodecahedron). Slightly rounded versions 
of the Platonic solids made of stone have been discovered in areas inhabited by the late 
Neolithic people of Scotland at least 1,000 years before Plato. The German astronomer 
Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) constructed models of Platonic solids nested within one 
another in an attempt to describe the orbits of the planets about the sun. Although 
Kepler’s theories were wrong, he was one of the first scientists to insist on a geometrical 
explanation for celestial phenomena.

Aristotle’s Organon 

Aristotle (384 B.C.-322 B.C.) 


Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and scientist, a pupil of Plato, and a teacher of 
Alexander the Great. The Organon (Instrument) refers to the collection of six of Aristotle’s 
works on logic: Categories, Prior Analytics, De Interpretatione, Posterior Analytics, 
Sophistical Refutations, and Topics. Andronicus of Rhodes determined the ordering of 
the six works around 40 B.C. Although Plato (c. 428-348 B.C.) and Socrates (c. 470- 
399 B.C.) delved into logical themes, Aristotle actually systematized the study of logic, 
which dominated scientific reasoning in the Western world for 2,000 years. 

The goal of the Organon is not to tell readers what is true, but rather to give 
approaches for how to investigate truth and how to make sense of the world. The 
primary tool in Aristotle’s tool kit is the syllogism, a three-step argument, such as “Ah 
women are mortal; Cleopatra is a woman; therefore, Cleopatra is mortal.” If the two 
premises are true, we know that the conclusion must be true. Aristotle also made a 
distinction between particulars and universals (general categories). Cleopatra is a 
particular term. Woman and mortal are universal terms. When universals are used, 
they are preceded by “all,” “some,” or “no.” Aristotle analyzed many possible kinds of 
syllogisms and showed which of them are valid. 

Aristotle also extended his analysis to syllogisms drat involved modal logic—that 
is, statements containing the words “possibly” or “necessarily.” Modem mathematical 
logic can depart from Aristotle’s methodologies or extend his work into other kinds of 
sentence structures, including ones that express more complex relationships or ones that 
involve more than one quantifier, such as “No women like all women who dislike some 
women." Nevertheless, Aristotle's systematic attempt at developing logic is considered 
to be one of humankind s greatest achievements, providing an early impetus for fields of 
mathematics that are in close partnership with logic and even influencing theologians in 
their quest to understand reality.

Mathematica (1910-1913), Gfcdels Theorem (1931), and Fuzzy Logic (1965).

Aristotle's Wheel Paradox 


Aristotle (384 B.C.-322 B.C.) 


The paradox of Aristotle’s wheel is mentioned in the ancient Greek text Mechanica. The 
problem has haunted some of the greatest mathematicians for centuries. Consider a 
small wheel mounted on a large wheel, diagrammed as two concentric circles. A one-to- 
one correspondence exists between points on the larger circle and those on the smaller 
circle; that is, for each point in the large circle, there is exactly one point on the small 
circle, and vice versa. Thus, the wheel assembly might be expected bo travel the same 
horizontal distance regardless of whether it is rolled on a rod that touches the smaller 
wheel or rolled along the bottom wheel that touches the road. But how can this be? 

After all, we know that die two circumferences of the circles are different. 

Today, mathematicians know that a one-to-one correspondence of points doesn’t 
mean that two curves must have the same length. Georg Cantor (1845—1918) showed 
that the number, or cardinality, of points on line segments of any length is the same. He 
called this Transfinite Number of points the “continuum.” For example, all the points 
in a segment from zero to one can even be put in one-to-one correspondence with all 
points of an infinite line. Of course, before the work of Cantor, mathematicians had 
quite a difficult time with this problem. Also note that, from a physical standpoint, if the 
large wheel did roll along the road, the smaller wheel would skip and be dragged along 
the line that touches its surface. 

The precise date and authorship of Mechanica may forever be shrouded in mystery. 
Although often attributed as the work of Aristotle, many scholars doubt that Mechanica, 
the oldest-known textbook on engineering, was actually written by Aristotle. Another 
possible candidate for authorship is Aristotle’s student Straton of Lampsacus (also known 
as Strato Physicus), who died around 270 B.C.

Euclid’s Elements 


Euclid of Alexandria (c. 325 B.C -c. 270 B.C.) 


The geometer Euclid of Alexandria lived in Hellenistic Egypt, and his book Elements 
is one of the most successful textbooks in the history of mathematics. His presentation 
of plane geometry is based on theorems that can all be derived from just five simple 
axioms, or postulates, one of which is that only one straight line can be drawn between 
any two points. Given a point and a line, another famous postulate suggests that only 
one line through the point is parallel to the first line. In the 1800s, mathematicians 
finally explored Non-Euclidean Geometries, in which the parallel postulate was 
no longer always required. Euclid's methodical approach of proving mathematical 
theorems by logical reasoning not only laid die foundations of geometry but also shaped 
countless other areas concerning logic and mathematical proofs. 

Elements consists of 13 books that cover two- and three-dimensional geometries, 
proportions, and the theory of numbers. Elements was one of the first books to be printed 
after the invention of file printing press and was used for centuries as part of university 
curricula. More than 1,000 editions of Elements have been published since its original 
printing in 1482. Although Euclid was probably not the first to prove the various results 
in Elements, his clear organization and style made the work of lasting significance. 
Mathematical historian Thomas Heath called Elements “the greatest mathematical 
textbook of all time.” Scientists like Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton were strongly 
influenced by Elements. Philosopher and logician Bertrand Russell wrote, “At the age 
of eleven, I began Euclid, with my brother as my tutor. This was one of the great 
events of my life, as dazzling as first love. I had not imagined that there was anything 
so delicious in the world.” The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote, "Euclid alone has 
looked on Beauty bare.”

Archimedes: Sand, Cattle & 
Stomachion 


Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 B.C.-c. 212 B.C.) 

In 1941, mathematician G. H. Hardy wrote, “Archimedes will be remembered when 
[playwright] Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas 
do not 'Immortality' may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best 
chance of whatever it may mean.” Indeed, Archimedes, the ancient Greek geometer, 
is often regarded as the greatest mathematician and scientist of antiquity and one of the 
four greatest mathematicians to have walked the Earth—together with Isaac Newton, 
Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Leonhard Euler. Interestingly, Archimedes sometimes sent 
his colleagues false theorems in order to trap them when they stole his ideas. 

In addition to many other mathematical ideas, he is famous for his contemplation 
of tremendously large numbers. In his book The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes estimated 
that 8 X 10 63 grains of sand would fill the universe. 

More amazingly, the number 7.760271406486818269530232833213... x 10 2O2W 
is the solution to one version of Archimedes' famous “cattle problem,” which involves 
computing the total number of cattle in a puzzle concerning four hypothetical herds of 
different colors. Archimedes wrote that anyone who could solve the problem would be 
“crowned with glory” and would be "adjudged perfect in this species of wisdom.” Not 
until 1880 did mathematicians have an approximate answer. A more precise number was 
first calculated in 1965 by Canadian mathematicians Hugh C. Williams, R. A German, 
and C. Robert Zamke using an IBM 7040 computer. 

In 2003, math historians discovered long lost information on the Stomachion 
of Archimedes. In particular, an ancient parchment, overwritten by monks nearly a 
thousand years ago, describes Archimedes’ Stomachion, a puzzle involving combina¬ 
torics. Combinatorics is a field of math dealing with the number of ways a given 
problem can be solved. The goal of the Stomachion is to determine in how many 
ways the 14 pieces shown here can be put together to make a square. In 2003, four 
mathematicians determined that the number is 17,152.

Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 B.C.-c. 212 B.C.) 

Pi, symbolized by die Greek letter tt, is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its 
diameter and is approximately equal to 3.14159. Perhaps ancient peoples observed 
that for every revolution of a cartwheel, a cart moves forward about three times the 
diameter of the wheel—an early recognition that the circumference is about three times 
the diameter. An ancient Babylonian tablet states that the ratio of the circumference 
of a circle to the perimeter of an inscribed hexagon is 1 to 0.96, implying a value of 
pi of 3.125. Greek mathematician Archimedes (c. 250 B.C.) was the first to give us a 
mathematically rigorous range for tt— a value between 223/71 and 22/7. The Welsh 
mathematician William Jones (1675—1749) introduced the symbol tt in 1706, most 
likely after the Greek word for periphery, which starts with the letter tt. 

The most famous ratio in mathematics is tt, on Earth and probably for any advanced 
civilization in the universe. The digits of tt never end, nor has anyone detected an orderly 
pattern in their arrangement. The speed with which a computer can compute tt is an 
interesting measure of a computer s computational ability, and today we know more than 
a trillion digits of / n\ 

We usually associate t t with a circle, and so did pre-seventeenth-century humanity. 
However, in the seventeenth century, tt was freed from the circle. Many curves were 
invented and studied (for example, various arches, hypocycloids, and curves known as 
witches), and it was found that their areas could be expressed in terms of tt. Finally, tt 
appeared to flee geometry altogether, and today tt relates to unaccountably many areas 
in number theory, probability, complex numbers, and series of simple fractions, such 

as tt/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 — 1/7_In 2006, Akira Haraguchi, a retired Japanese engineer, 

set a world record for memorizing and reciting 100,000 digits of tt.

Sieve of Eratosthenes 


Eratosthenes (c. 276 B.C.-c. 194 B.C.) 

A prime number is a number larger than 1, such as 5 or 13, that is divisible only by itself 
or 1. The number 14 is not prime because 14 = 7 x 2. Prime numbers have fascinated 
mathematicians for more than two thousand years. Around 300 B.C., Euclid showed 
that there is no “largest prime” and that an infinitude of prime numbers exists. But how 
can we determine if a number is prime? Around 240 B.C, the Greek mathematician 
Eratosthenes developed the first-known test for primality, which we today call the Sieve 
of Eratosthenes. In particular, the Sieve can be used to find all prime numbers up to a 
specified integer. (The ever-versatile Eratosthenes served as the director of the famous 
library in Alexandria and was also the first person to provide a reasonable estimation of 
the diameter of the Earth.) 

The French theologian and mathematician Marin Mersenne (1588-1648) was also 
fascinated by prime numbers, and he tried to find a formula that he could use to find all 
primes. Although he did not find such a formula, his work on Mersenne numbers of the 
form 2^-1. where p is an integer, continues to be of interest to us today. Mersenne 
numbers, with p a prime number, are the easiest type of number to prove prime, so they are 
usually the largest primes of which humanity is aware. The forty-fifth known Mersenne 
prime (2 43 * 112 ’ 609 — 1) was discovered in 2008, and it contains 12,978,189 digits! 

Today, prime numbers play an important role in public-key cryptography algorithms 
that may be used for sending secure messages. More important, for pure mathematicians, 
prime numbers have been at the heart of many intriguing unsolved conjectures through 
history, including the Riemaim Hypothesis, which concerns the distribution of prime 
numbers, and the strong Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer 
greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes.

Archimedean Semi-Regular Polyhedra 

Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 B.C.-c. 212 B.C.) 

Like Platonic Solids, Archimedean semi-regular polyhedra (ASRP) are convex, 
multifaceted 3-D objects whose faces are all regular polygons that have sides of equal 
length and angles of equal degrees. However, for the ASRP, the faces are of different 
kinds. For example, die polyhedron formed by 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons, which 
resembles a modem soccer ball, was described by Archimedes along with 12 other such 
polyhedra. Around every vertex (comer) of these kinds of solids, the same polygons 
appear in the same sequence—for example, hexagon-hexagon-triangle. 

Archimedes’ original writings that described the 13 ASRP are lost and known only 
from other sources. During the Renaissance, artists discovered all but one ASRP. In 
1619, Kepler presented the entire set in his book Harmonicas Mundi (The Harmonies of 
the World). ASRPs may be specified using a numerical notation that indicates the shapes 
around a vertex. For example, 3,5,3,5 means that a triangle, pentagon, triangle, and 
pentagon appear in that order. Using this notation, we have the following ASRPs: 3,4,3,4 
(a cuboctahedron); 3,5,3,5 (an icosidodecahedron); 3,6,6 (a truncated tetrahedron); 

4,6,6 (a truncated octahedron); 3,8,8 (a truncated cube); 5,6,6 (a truncated icosahedron, 
or soccer ball); 3,10,10 (a truncated dodecahedron); 3,4,4,4 (a rhombicuboctahedron); 
4,6,8 (a truncated cuboctahedron); 3,4,5,4 (a rhombicosidodecahedron); 4,6,10 (a 
truncated icosidodecahedron); 3,3,3,3,4 (a snub cube, or snub cuboctahedron); and 
3,3,3,3,5 (a snub dodecahedron, or snub icosidodecahedron). 

The 32-faced truncated icosahedron is particularly fascinating. Soccer ball shapes 
are based on this Archimedean solid, and this was also the configuration used for 
arranging lenses that focused the explosive shock waves of the detonators in the "Fat 
Man” atomic bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, in World War II. In the 1980s, 
chemists succeeded in creating the world’s tiniest soccer ball, a carbon molecule with 
60 atoms at the vertices of a truncated icosahedron. These so-called Buckyballs have 
fascinating chemical and physical properties that are being explored in applications 
ranging from lubrication to AIDS treatments.

Archimedes’ Spiral 

Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 B.C.-c. 212 B.C.) 

The term spiral is often used generically to describe any geometrically smooth curve 
that winds about a central point or axis while also receding from it. When we think of 
examples of spirals, both the mundane and the exotic come to mind—the gentle curl 
of a fem tendril, the shape of an octopus's retracted arm, the death form assumed by a 
centipede, the spiral intestine of a giraffe, the shape of a butterfly's tongue, and the spiral 
cross section of a scroll. Spirals possess a simple beauty that humans have copied in their 
arts and tools, and that nature has used in the creation of many structures of life. 

The mathematics of tire simplest spiral form, the spiral of Archimedes, was first 
discussed by Archimedes in 225 B.C. in his book On Spirals. This spiral can be 
expressed by the equation r = a + b6. The parameter a rotates tire entire spiral, and b 
controls the distance between the successive turnings. The most commonly observed 
spirals are of the Archimedean type: tightly wound springs, edges of rolled-up mgs, and 
decorative spirals on jewelry. Practical uses of the Archimedes spiral have included 
the transformation of rotary to linear motion in sewing machines. The Archimedean 
spiral spring is particularly interesting in its ability to respond to both torsional and 
translational force. 

Ancient examples of Archimedean spirals include prehistoric spiral mazes, terra¬ 
cotta pot spiral designs from the sixth century B.C., decorations from ancient Altaic 
works (middle of the first millennium B.C.), engravings on threshold stones of initiation 
chambers in the Bronze Age in Ireland, scrollworks for Irish manuscripts, and Tibetan 
Tanka artworks, the latter of which are painted or embroidered Buddhist designs 
sometimes hung in monasteries. In fact, the spiral is a ubiquitous symbol throughout the 
ancient world. Its frequent appearance at burial sites suggests that this symbol may have 
represented a cycle of life, death, and rebirth, as with tire continual rising and falling of 
the sun.

Cissoid of Diodes 


Diodes (c. 240 B.C.-c. 180 B.C.) 


The cissoid of Diodes was discovered by Greek mathematician Diodes, around 180 
B.C., during his attempts to use its remarkable properties to double a cube. “Doubling 
the cube” refers to a famous and ancient challenge of constructing a cube with a volume 
twice the volume of a given smaller cube, which means that the larger cube has an edge 
that is *JT times larger than the first cube. Diodes’ use of the cissoid, and its intersection 
with a straight line, was theoretically correct, but did not rigorously follow the rules of 
Euclidean construction that allowed the use of only a compass and a straightedge. 

The name cissoid comes from the Greek term meaning “ivy-shaped.” The graph 
of the curve extends to infinity along both directions of the y-axis and has a single cusp. 
Both branches of the curve that extend away from the cusp approach the same vertical 
asymptote. If we draw a circle that passes through the cusp at point O and that is tangent 
to tire asymptote, then any line joining the cusp and a point M on the cissoid can be 
extended so that it intersects the asymptote at B. The length of the linear extension from 
C to B is always equal to the length between O and M. The curve may be expressed 
in polar coordinates as r = 2a(sec 0 - cos 0) or in 
rectangular coordinates as y 2 = x^!(la ~ x). Interestingly, 
the cissoid can be produced by tracing the vertex of 
a parabola as it rolls, without slipping, on a second 
parabola of the same size. 

Diodes was fascinated by curves known as conic 
sections, and in his work On Burning Mirrors he discussed 
the focal point of a parabola. One of his goals was to find 
a mirror surface that focuses the maximum amount of 
heat when it is placed in sunlight.

Ptolemy’s Almagest 

Claudius Ptolemaeus (c. 90-c. 168) 


Mathematician and astronomer Ptolemy of Alexandria wrote the 13-book Almagest, 
a comprehensive treatise on virtually all aspects of astronomy known at his time. In 
the Almagest, Ptolemy deals with the apparent movement of the planets and stars. His 
geocentric model, in which the Earth is at the center of the universe and the Sun and 
planets orbit around the Earth, was accepted as correct for more than a thousand years 
in Europe and in the Arabic world. 

Almagest is the Latin form of the Arabic name al-kitabu-l-mijisti ( The Great Book), 
and the work is of particular interest to mathematicians due to its trigonometric content, 
which includes the equivalent of a table of sine values for angles from 0° to 90° at 
15-minute intervals and an introduction to spherical trigonometry. The Almagest also 
contains theorems that correspond to our modem “law of sines” and compound-angle 
and half-angle identities. Jan Gullberg writes, “That so much of early Greek work 
on astronomy has been lost could be a result of the completeness and elegance of 
presentation of Ptolemy’s Almagest, making all earlier works appear superfluous.” Gerd 
Grasshoff writes, "Ptolemy’s Almagest shares with Euclid's Elements the glory of being 
the scientific text longest in use. From its conception in the second century up to die 
late Renaissance, this work determined astronomy as a science.” 

The Almagest was translated into Arabic around the year 827 and then from Arabic 
to Latin in the twelfth century. The Persian mathematician and astronomer Abu al-Wafa 
(940-998) built upon the Almagest and systemized trigonometric theorems and proofs. 

Interestingly, Ptolemy attempted to compute the size of the universe based on 
his models of planetary motions in which a planet moves in a small circle, called 
an epicycle, which in turn moves along a larger circle. He estimated that a sphere 
containing the faraway "fixed stars" was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth. 

SEE ALSO Euclid’s Elements (300 B C ) and Law of Cosines (c. 1427). 


Ptolemy's Almagest describes a geocentric model of the universe, which places the Earth at the center of the 
universe , and the Sun and planets orbit around the Earth . This model was accepted for more than a thousand 
years in Europe and in the Arabic world.

Diophantus’s Arithmetica 

Diophantus of Alexandria (c. 200~c. 284) 

Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria, sometimes called the “father of algebra," 
was the author of Arithmetica (c. 250), a series of mathematical texts that has influenced 
mathematics for centuries. Arithmetica, the most famous work on algebra in all of Greek 
mathematics, contains various problems along with numerical solutions to equations. 
Diophantus is also important due to his advances in mathematical notation and his 
treatment of fractions as numbers. In the dedication to Arithmetica, Diophantus writes to 
Dionysus (most likely tire bishop of Alexandria) that although the material in the book 
may be difficult, "it will be easy to grasp, with your enthusiasm and my teaching." 

Diophantus’s various works were preserved by the Arabs and translated into Latin in 
the sixteenth century. Diophantine equations, with their integer solutions, are named 
in his honor. Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous Fermat’s Last Theorem involving 
integer solutions of a n + b n = d 1 in a French translation of Arithmetica, published in 1681. 

In Arithmetica, Diophantus was often interested in finding integer solutions for 
equations like ax 2 - + bx — c. Although the Babylonians were aware of some methods 
for solving linear and quadratic equations of the kind that fascinated Diophantus, 
Diophantus is special, according to J. D. Swift, for being "the first to introduce extensive 
and consistent algebraic notation representing a tremendous improvement over the purely 
verbal style of his predecessors (and many successors).... The rediscovery of Arithmetica 
through Byzantine sources greatly aided the renaissance of mathematics in Western 
Europe and stimulated many mathematicians, of whom the greatest was Fermat” 

Note that Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi (780-850) also shares the title 
“father of algebra” for his own book Algebra, which contained a systematic solution of 
linear and quadratic equations. Al-Khwarizmi introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals and 
algebraic concepts into European mathematics, and the words algorithm and algebra 
are derived from his name and al-jabr, respectively. Al-jabr is an Arabic word for a 
mathematical operation used to solve quadratic equations.

Pappus’s Hexagon Theorem 

Pappus of Alexandria (c. 290-c. 350) 


A farmer wishes to plant nine maple trees so that they form ten straight rows with three 
trees in each row. One curious way to achieve this goal makes use of Pappus's theorem. 
If three points A, B, C are located anywhere along one line, and three points D, E, F are 
located anywhere on a second line. Pappus’s theorem guarantees that the intersections 
X, Y, Z of opposite sides of a crossed hexagon A, F, B, D, C, E lie on a straight line. The 
farmer can solve his problem and form a tenth row by sliding tree B to bring B, Y, and E 
into alignment 

Pappus was one of foe most important Hellenistic mathematicians of his age and 
famous for Synagoge (Collection) written in c. 340. The work focuses on topics in 
geometry that include polygons, polyhedra, circles, spirals, and honeycomb construction 
by bees. The Synagoge is also valuable because it includes results based on ancient 
works that have subsequently been lost Thomas Heath writes of Synagoge, "Obviously 
written with die object of reviving the classical Greek geometry, it covers practically 
the whole field.” 

About the famous theorem of Pappus, Max Dehn writes that it “marks an event in 
the history of geometry. From the beginning, geometry was concerned with measures: 
lengths of lines, areas of plane figures, and volumes of bodies. Here, we have for the 
first time a theorem which is established by the ordinary theory of measures but is itself 
free of all elements of measurements.” In other words, the theorem demonstrates the 
existence of a figure that is determined only through the incidence of lines and points. 
Dehn also says that this figure is the “first configuration of projective geometry " 

Synagoge became widely known in Europe after 1588, when a Latin translation by 
Federico Commandino was printed. Pappus’s figure intrigued Isaac Newton and Ren£ 
Descartes. About 1,300 years after Pappus wrote Synagoge, French mathematician Blaise 
Pascal provided an interesting generalization of Pappus’s theorem.

Bakhshali Manuscript 


The Bakhshali manuscript is a famous mathematical collection, discovered in 1881 
within a stone enclosure in northwest India, and it may even date back to the third 
century. When it was discovered, a large part of the manuscript had been destroyed, and 
only about 70 leaves of birch bark survived to the time of its discovery. The Bakhshali 
manuscript provides techniques and rules for solving arithmetic, algebra, and geometry 
problems, and it provides a formula for calculating the square root 

Here is one problem from the manuscript: “Before you is a group of 20 people 
comprising men, women, and children. They earn 20 coins between them. Each man 
earns 3 coins, each woman 1.5 coins, and each child half a coin. How many men, 
women, and children are there?” Can you solve this? The solution turns out to be 2 
men, 5 women, and 13 children. We can let the number of men, women, and children 
be m, w, and c, respectively. Two formulas describe our situation: m + w + c = 20 and 
3m + (3/2)w + (1/2)c = 20. The solution given is the only valid one. 

The manuscript was found near the village of Bakhshali in the Yusufzai subdivision 
of the Peshawar district (now in Pakistan). The date of the manuscript is subject to much 
debate, however, a number of scholars believe it to be a commentary on an older work 
that may have existed around A.D. 200 to 400. One unusual feature of the Bakhshali 
notation is the use of a “+” sign placed after a number to indicate a negative. Equations 
are given with a large dot representing the unknown value that is being sought. A similar 
dot is used to represent zero. Dick Teresi writes, “Most important is that the Bakhshali 
manuscript is the first document depicting a form of Indian mathematics devoid of 
religious association.”

The Death of Hypatia 

Hypatia of Alexandria (c. 370-c. 415) 


Hypatia of Alexandria was martyred by being tom to shreds by a Christian mob, partly 
because she did not adhere to strict Christian principles. She considered herself a neo- 
Platonist, a pagan, and a follower of Pythagorean ideas. Interestingly, Hypatia is the first 
woman mathematician in the history of humanity of whom we have reasonably secure 
and detailed knowledge. She was said to be physically attractive and determinedly 
celibate. When asked why she was obsessed with mathematics and would not marry, she 
replied that she was wedded to the truth. 

Hypatia s works include commentaries on Diophantus’s Arithmetica. In one of 
her mathematical problems for her students, she asked them for the integer solution of 
the pair of simultaneous equations: x - y = a and x 2 - y 2 = (x - y) + b, where a and 
b are known. Can you find any integer values for x, y, a, and b that make both of these 
formulas true? 

The Christians were her strongest philosophical rivals, and they officially discouraged 
her Platonic assertions about the nature of God and the afterlife. On a warm March day 
in AD. 414, a crowd of Christian zealots seized her, stripped her, and proceeded to scrape 
her flesh from her bones using sharp shells. Next, they cut up her body and burned the 
pieces. Like some victims of religious terrorism today, she may have been seized merely 
because she was a famous person on the other side of the religious divide. It was not until 
after the Renaissance that another woman, Maria Agnesi, made her name as a famous 
mathematician. 

Hypatia’s death triggered the departure of many scholars from Alexandria and, in 
many ways, marked the end of centuries of Greek progress in mathematics. During 
the European Dark Ages, Arabs and Hindus were the ones to play the leading roles in 
fostering the progress of mathematics.

Zero 


Brahmagupta (c. 598-c. 668), Bhaskara (c. 600-c. 680), 

Mahavira (c. 800-c. 870) 

The ancient Babylonians originally had no symbol for zero, which caused uncertainty 
in their notation, just as today we would be confused if numbers like 12, 102, and 1,002 
had no zero to distinguish them. The Babylonian scribes only left a space where a zero 
should be, and it was not easy to distinguish the number of spaces in the middle or at 
the ends of numbers. Eventually, the Babylonians did invent a symbol to mark the gap 
between their digits, but they probably had no concept of zero as an actual number. 

Around A.D. 650, the use of the number was common in Indian mathematics, and 
a stone tablet was found in Gwalior, south of Delhi, with the numbers 270 and 50. The 
numbers on die tablet, dated to AD. 876, look very similar to modem numbers, except 
that the zeros are smaller and raised. Indian mathematicians such as Brahmagupta, 
Mahavira, and Bhaskara used zero in mathematical operations. For example, Brahmagupta 
explained that a number subtracted from itself gives zero, and he noted that any number 
when multiplied by zero is zero. The Bakhshali Manuscript may be the first documented 
evidence of zero used for mathematical purposes, but its date is unclear. 

Around AD. 665, the Mayan civilization in Central America also developed die 
number zero, but its achievement did not seem to influence other peoples. On the other 
hand, the Indian concept of zero spread to the Arabs, Europeans, and Chinese, and 
changed the world. 

Mathematician Hossein Arsham writes, “The introduction of zero into the decimal 
system in the thirteenth century was the most significant achievement in the development 
of a number system, in which calculation with large numbers became feasible. Without 
the notion of zero, the... modeling processes in commerce, astronomy, physics, chemistry, 
and industry would have been unthinkable. The lack of such a symbol is one of the 
serious drawbacks in the Roman numeral system.”

The notion of zero ignited a fire that eventually allowed humanity to more easily work with large numbers and to 
become efficient in calculations in fields ranging from commerce to physics. 











Alcuin s Propositiones ad 
Acuendos Juvenes 

Alcuin of York (c. 735-c 804), Gerbert of Aurillac (c. 946-c. 1003) 


Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus, also known as Alcuin of York, was a scholar from York, 
England. At die invitation of King Charlemagne, he became a leading teacher at the 
Carolingian court, where he wrote theological treatises and poems. He was abbot of the 
Abbey of Saint Martin at Tours in 796 and foremost scholar of die revival of learning 
known as the Carolingian Renaissance. 

Scholars speculate that his mathematics book Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes 
(Problems to Sharpen the Young) contributed to the education of the last Pope 
Mathematician, Gerbert of Aurillac, who was fascinated by mathematics and elected as 
Pope Sylvester II in 999. This popes advanced knowledge of mathematics convinced 
some of his enemies that he was an evil magician. 

In the city of Reims, France, the "Number Pope” transformed the floor of the 
cathedral into a giant abacus. He also adopted Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
and 9) as a replacement for Roman numerals. He contributed to die invention of the 
pendulum clock, invented devices that tracked planetary orbits, and wrote on geometry. 
When he realized that he lacked knowledge of formal logic, he studied under German 
logicians. The Number Pope said, "The just man lives by faith, but it is good that he 
should combine science with his faith.” 

Alcunius’s Propositiones contained roughly 50 word problems with solutions, the 
most famous of which involve river crossings, counting doves on a ladder, a dying father 
leaving vessels of wine to his sons, and three jealous husbands, each of whom can’t 
let another man be alone with his wife. Several major classes of problems appear for 
the first time in Propositiones. Mathematics writer Ivars Peterson notes that "Browsing 
the problems (and solutions) in Propositiones provides fascinating glimpses of various 
aspects of life in medieval times. And it testifies to the enduring power of puzzles in 
mathematical education.”

Al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra 

Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-c. 850) 


Al-Khwarizmi was a Persian mathematician and astronomer who spent most of his life in 
Baghdad. His book on algebra, Kitab al-mukhtasar ft hisab al-jabr wa'l-muqabala (The 
Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing) was the first book on 
the systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations and is sometimes referred to 
by the shortened title Algebra. Along with Diophantus, he is considered the “father of 
algebra” The Latin translation of his works introduced the decimal positional number 
system to Europe. Interestingly, the word algebra comes from al-jabr, one of the two 
operations used in his book to solve quadratic equations. 

For al-Khwarizmi, al-jabr is a method in which we can eliminate negative quantities 
in an equation by adding the same quantity to each side. For example, we can reduce 
x 2 = 5Ox - Sx 2 to 6x 2 = 50x by adding 5X 2 to both sides. Al-muqabala is a method 
whereby we gather quantities of the same type to the same side of the equation. For 
example, x 2 + l5=x + 5is reduced to x 2 + 10 = x. 

The book helped readers to solve equations such as those of the forms x 2 + lOx 
= 39, x 2 + 21 = lOx, and 3x + 4 = x 2 , but more generally, al-Khwarizmi believed that 
the difficult mathematical problems could be solved if broken down into a series of 
smaller steps. Al-Khwarizmi intended his book to be practical, helping people to make 
calculations that deal with money, property inheritance, lawsuits, trade, and the digging 
of canals. His book also contained example problems and solutions. 

Al-Khwarizmi worked most of his life in the Baghdad House of Wisdom, a library, 
translation institute, and place of learning that was a major intellectual center of the 
Islamic Golden Age. Alas, the Mongols destroyed the House of Wisdom in 1258, and 
legend says that the waters of the Tigris ran black with ink from the books tossed into 
its waters.

Borromean Rings 

Peter Guthrie Tait (1831-1901) 

A simple yet intriguing set of interlocking objects of interest to mathematicians and 
chemists is formed by Borromean rings—three mutually interlocked rings named 
after the Italian Renaissance family who used them on its coat of arms in the fifteenth 
century. 

Notice that Borromean rings have no two rings that are linked, so if we cut any one 
of the rings, all three rings come apart. Some historians speculate that the ancient ring 
configurations once represented the three families of Visconti, Sforza, and Bonomeo, 
who formed a tenuous union through intermarriages. The rings also appear in 1467 in 
the Church of San Pancrazio in Florence. Even older, triangular versions were used 
by the Vikings, one famous example of which was found on a bedpost of a prominent 
woman who died in 834. 

The rings appear in a mathematical context in the 1876 paper on knots by Scottish 
mathematical physicist Peter Tait Because two choices (over or under) are possible for 
each ring crossing, 2 6 = 64 possible interlaced patterns exist. If we take symmetry into 
account, only 10 of these patterns are geometrically distinct. 

Mathematicians now know that we cannot actually construct a true set of Borromean 
rings with fiat circles, and, in fact, you can see this for yourself if you try to create the 
interlocked rings out of wire, which requires some deformation or kinks in the wires. In 
1987, Michael Freedman and Richard Skora proved the theorem stating that Borromean 
rings are impossible to construct with fiat circles. 

In 2004, UCLA chemists created a molecular Borromean ring compound that 
was 2.5 nanometers across and that included six metal ions. Researchers are currently 
contemplating ways in which they may use molecular Borromean rings in such 
diverse fields as spintronics (a technology that exploits electron spin and charge) and 
medical imaging.

This Borromean ring motif was found in a thirteenthaentury French manuscript where it symbolized the 
Christian Trinity The original contains trinitas (Latin for ‘Trinity” or “three in me”) broken into its three 
syllables—tri, ni, and tas—that were written in the three circles. 





Ganita Sara Samgraha 

Mahavira (c. 800-c. 870) 

The Ganita Sara Samgraha (Compendium of the Essence of Mathematics), dated 
A.D. 850, is special for several reasons. First, it is the only existing treatise on arithmetic 
by a Jaina scholar. Second, it included essentially all mathematical knowledge of mid- 
ninth-century India. It is the earliest extant Indian text devoted entirely to mathematics. 

Ganita was written by Mahavira (or Mahaviracharya, meaning "Mahavira the 
Teacher”), who lived in southern India. One particular problem in the book has 
delighted scholars for centuries and was worded as follows: A young lady has a quarrel 
with her husband and damages her necklace. One-third of the necklace’s pearls scatter 
toward the lady. One-sixth fell on the bed. One-half of what remains (and one-half 
of what remains thereafter and again one-half of what remains after that, and so on, 
counting six times in all) fell everywhere else. A total of 1,161 pearls were found to 
remain unscattered. How many pearls did the girl originally have in total? 

The astounding answer is that the girl originally had 148,608 pearls on her 
necklace! Let’s reflect on the problem. One-sixth fell on the bed. One-third scattered 
toward her. This means the remaining pearls that are neither on the bed nor near her 
are half of all the pearls. The remaining pearls are halved six times, so ((l/2) 7 )x = 1,161, 
where x is the total number of pearls; thus, x is 148,608. The Indian woman’s huge 
necklace was well worth quarreling over! 

Ganita was notable for its explicit assertion that the square root of a negative 
number did not exist In Ganita, Mahavira also discussed the properties of the number 
zero and provided a naming scheme for numbers from 10 up to 10 7 ^, methods for 
obtaining the sum of a series whose terms are squares of an arithmetical progression, 
rules for determining the area and perimeter of an ellipse, and methods for solving 
linear and quadratic equations.

Thabit Formula for Amicable 
Numbers 


Thabit ibn Qurra (826-901) 

The Pythagoreans of ancient Greece were fascinated by amicable numbers for which 
each such number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. (A proper divisor of a 
number does not include the number itself.) The smallest such pair is 220 and 284. The 
number 220 is evenly divisible by 1, 2,4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,44, 55, and 110, which sum 
to 284, and 284 is evenly divisible by 1, 2,4, 71, and 142, which sum to 220. 

In 850, Thabit ibn Qurra, an Arab astronomer and mathematician, presented a 
formula that could be used to generate amicable numbers. Compute p = 3 x 2 n “ 1 - 1, 
q = 3 x 2” — 1, and r = 9 x 2 2n ~ 1 — 1 for an integer n > 1. If p, q, and r are prime 
numbers, then 2 n pq and 2”r are a pair of amicable numbers. When n = 2, this gives the 
numbers 220 and 284, but the formula does not generate every amicable number that 
exists. In every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both even or both odd. Will 
we ever discover an even-odd amicable pair? Amicable numbers are quite difficult to 
find. For example, by 1747, Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician and physicist, had 
found only 30 pairs. Today, we know of more than 11 million pairs, but only 5,001 of 
such pairs have both numbers less than 3.06 x 10’h 

In Genesis 32:14, Jacob gives a present of 220 goats to his brother. According to 
mystics, this was a “hidden secret arrangement” because 220 is one of a pair of amicable 
numbers, and Jacob sought to secure friendship with Esau. Martin Gardner, a popular 
mathematics and science writer, stated, “One poor Arab of the eleventh century 
recorded that he once tested the erotic effect of eating something labeled with 284, at 
the same time having someone else swallow something labeled 220, but he foiled to add 
how the experiment worked out”

Chapters in Indian Mathematics 

Abu’l Hasan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Uqlidisi (c. 920-c. 980) 


Al-Uqlidisi ("the Euclidian”) was an Arab mathematician whose Kitab al-fusul fi 
al-hisab al-Hindi (Chapters in Indian Mathematics) is the earliest-known Arabic work 
discussing the positional use of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, meaning the use of digits 
corresponding to 0 through 9 in which each position starting from the right of a 
multi-digit number corresponds to a power of 10 (for example, 1,10,100, and 1,000). 
Al-Uqlidisi’s work also represents the earliest-known arithmetic extant in Arabic. Although 
al-Uqlidisi was bom and died in Damascus, he was well traveled and may have learned 
about Hindu mathematics in India. Only one copy of this manuscript remains today. 

Al-Uqlidisi also discussed the problems of previous mathematicians in terms of the 
new system of numerals. Dick Teresi, the author of several books about science and 
technology, writes, “His name was evidence of his reverence for the Greeks. He copied 
the works of Euclid, hence the name al-Uqlidisi. One of his legacies is paper-and-pen 
mathematics.” During al-Uqlidisi’s time, it was common in India and the Islamic world 
to perform mathematical calculations in the sand or in dust, erasing steps with one’s 
hand as one proceeded. Al-Uqlidisi suggested that paper and pen be used instead. 
Written arithmetic preserves the process, and although his scheme did not involve 
erasure of ink numbers, it did permit greater flexibility in calculation. In a sense, paper 
drove the evolution of modem methods for performing multiplication and long division. 

R6gis Morelon, the editor of the Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, 
writes, “One of the most remarkable ideas in the arithmetic of al-Uqlidisi is the use 
of decimal fractions" and the use of the decimal symbol. For example, to halve 19 
successively, al-Uqlidisi gave the following: 19,9.5,4.75,2.375, 1.1875, 0.59375. 
Eventually, the advanced calculations enabled by the decimal system led to its common 
use throughout the region and the world.

Omar Khayyam’s Treatise 

Omai Khayyam (1048-1131) 


Omar Khayyam, the Persian mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, is best 
known for his collection of poems, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. However, he has 
also achieved great feme for his influential Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of 
Algebra (1070). Here, he derived methods for solving cubic and some higher-order 
equations. An example of a cubic equation that he solved is x 3 + 200x = 20x 2 + 2000. 
Although his approaches were not entirely new, his generalizations that could be used to 
solve all cubics were noteworthy. His Treatise contains a comprehensive classification of 
cubic equations with geometric solutions found by means of intersecting conic sections. 

Khayyam also was able to show how to obtain the nth power of the binomial 
a + b in powers of a and b, when n is any whole number. As background, consider the 
expression ( a + b) n , which equals (a + b) x (a + b) x (a + b). .. with n repetitions of 
(a + b). According to the binomial expansion, for example, (a + fe) 5 = u 5 + 5a*b + 

10 a?b 2 + 10u 2 £> 3 +5ab* + 6 5 . The numerical coefficients (1, 5,10,10, 5, and 1) are 
referred to as binomial coefficients, which are the values in a row of Pascal’s Triangle. 
Some of Khayyam’s work on this subject actually appears in another book to which he 
refers but which is now lost. 

Khayyam’s 1077 work on geometry, Sharh ma ashkala min musadarat kitab 
Uqlidis ( Commentaries on the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid’s Book), provides 
an interesting look at Euclid’s famous parallel postulate. In Sharh , Khayyam discussed 
properties of Non-Euclidean Geometries and thus stumbled into a realm of mathe¬ 
matics that would not flourish until the 1800s. 

A literal translation of Khayyam’s name is "tent maker” the possible trade of his 
father. Khayyam once referred to himself as one “who stitched the tents of science.”

Al-Samawal’s The Dazzling 

Ibn Yahya al-Maghribi al-Samawal (c. 1130-c. 1180), Abu Bakr ibn 
Muhammad ibn al Husayn al-Karaji (c. 953-c. 1029) 

Al-Samawal (also known as Samau’al al-Maghribi) was bom in Baghdad to a Jewish 
family. He started to develop his passion for mathematics at the age of 13 when he 
began his study using Hindu methods of calculation. By the time he was 18 years old, 
he had read almost all the available mathematical literature that existed in his day. Al- 
Samawal wrote his most famous work, al-Bahir fi’l-jabr (translated as either The Brilliant 
in Algebra or The Dazzling in Algebra), when he was only 19 years old. The Dazzling is 
significant for both its original ideas as well as its information concerning the lost works 
of the tenth-century Persian mathematician al-Karaji. 

The Dazzling emphasizes the principles of arithmetization of algebra, explaining 
how unknown arithmetic quantities, or variables, can be treated just like ordinary 
numbers when considering arithmetic operations. Al-Samawal goes on to define powers 
of numbers, polynomials, and methods for finding roots of polynomials. Many scholars 
consider The Dazzling to be the first treatise to assert that x° = 1 (in modem notation). 

In other words, al-Samawal realized and published the idea that any number raised to 
the power of 0 is 1. He was also quite comfortable with using negative numbers and zero 
in his work, considering such concepts (in modem notation) as 0 — a = -a. He also 
understood how to handle multiplication involving negative numbers and was proud 
of his finding l 2 + 2 2 4 3 2 +... + n 2 = n(n + l)(2n + 1)76, an expression that does not 
seem to appear in earlier works. 

In 1163, after a great deal of study and contemplation, al-Samawal converted from 
Judaism to Islam. He would have converted earlier in his life but delayed because he did 
not wish to hurt his father’s feelings. His work Decisive Refutation of the Christians and 
Jews still survives today.

Abacus 


In 2005, Forbes.com readers, editors, and a panel of experts ranked the abacus as the 
second most important tool of all time in terms of its impact on human civilization. 
(First and third on the list were the knife and the compass, respectively.) 

The modern abacus with beads and wires, used for counting, has it roots in ancient 
devices such as the Salamis tablet, the oldest surviving counting board used by the 
Babylonians around 300 B.C. These boards were usually wood, metal, or stone, and they 
contained lines or grooves along which beads or stones were moved. Around AD.1000, 
the Aztecs invented the nepohualtzitzin (referred to by aficionados as the “Aztec 
computer 7 '), an abacus-like device that made use of com kernels threaded through 
wooden frames to help operators perform computations. 

The abacus, as we know it today, which contains beads that move along wires, was 
used in AD. 1200 in China, where it was called the suan-pan. In Japan, die abacus 
is called die soroban. In some sense, die abacus may be considered the ancestor of 
the computer, and like the computer, the abacus serves as a tool to allow humans 
to perform fast calculations in commerce and in engineering. Abaci are still used in 
China, Japan, parts of the Soviet Union, and Africa, and sometimes by blind people, 
with slight variations in design. Although the abacus is generally used for fast addition 
and subtraction operations, experienced users are able to quickly multiply, divide, 
and calculate square roots. In 1946 in Tokyo, a calculating speed contest featured 
a competition between a Japanese soroban operator and a person using an electric 
calculator of that time. The soroban operator usually beat the electric calculator.

The abacus is among the most important took of all time in terms of its impact on human civilization. For 
many centuries, this device served as a tool to allow humans to perform fist calculations in commerce and in 
engineering.

Fibonacci’s Liber Abaci 


Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci, c. 1175-c. 1250) 

Carl Boyer refers to Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, as “without a doubt, 
the most original and most capable mathematician of the medieval Christian world.” 
Fibonacci, a wealthy Italian merchant, traveled through Egypt, Syria, and Barbary 
(Algeria), and in 1202 published the book Liber Abaci (The Book of the Abacus), 
which introduced the Hindu-Arabic numerals and decimal number system to Western 
Europe. This system is now used throughout the world, having overcome the terribly 
cumbersome Roman numerals common in Fibonacci’s time. In Liber Abaci, Fibonacci 
notes, “These are the nine figures of the Indians: 987654321. With these nine 
figures, and with this sign 0, which in Arabic is called zephirum, any number can be 
represented, as will be demonstrated.” 

Although Liber Abaci was not the first European book to describe the Hindu- 
Arabic numerals—and even though decimal numerals did not gain widespread use in 
Europe directly after its publication—the book is nevertheless considered to have had a 
strong impact on European thought because it was directed to both academicians and 
businesspeople. 

Liber Abaci also introduced Western Europe to the famous number sequence 
1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13..., which today is called the Fibonacci sequence. Notice that except 
for the first two numbers, every successive number in the sequence equals the sum 
of the previous two. These numbers appear in an amazing number of mathematical 
disciplines and in nature. 

Is God a mathematician? Certainly, the universe seems to be reliably understood 
using mathematics. Nature is mathematics. The arrangement of seeds in a sunflower 
can be understood using Fibonacci numbers. Sunflower heads, like those of other 
flowers, contain families of interlaced spirals of seeds—one spiral winding clockwise, 
the other counterclockwise. The number of spirals in such heads, as well as the 
number of petals in flowers, is very often a Fibonacci number.

Wheat on a Chessboard 


Abu-1 ‘Abbas Ahmad ibn Khallikan (1211-1282), Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) 

The problem of Sissa’s chessboard is notable in the history of mathematics because it 
has been used for centuries to demonstrate the nature of geometric growth or geometric 
progressions, and it is one of the earliest mentions of chess in puzzles. The Arabic 
scholar Ibn Khallikan in 1256 appears to be the first author to discuss the story of 
Grand Vizier Sissa ben Dahir, who, according to legend, was asked by the Indian King 
Shirham what reward he wanted for inventing the game of chess. 

Sissa addressed the king: “Majesty, I would be happy if you were to give me a grain 
of wheat to place on the first square of the chessboard, and two grains of wheat to place 
on the second square, and four grains of wheat to place on the third, and eight grains of 
wheat to place on the fourth, and so on for the sixty-four squares ” 

“And is that all you wish, Sissa, you fool?” die astonished King shouted. 

The king did not realize how many grains Sissa would be awardedl One way to 
determine the solution is to compute the sum of the first 64 terms of a geometrical 
progression, 1 + 2 + 2 2 +... + 2 63 = 2 s4 - 1, which is a walloping 18,446,744,073,709, 
551,615 grains of wheat. 

It is possible that some version of this story was known to Dante, because he referred 
to a similar concept in the Paradiso to describe the abundance of Heaven's lights: 

“They were so many that their number piles up faster than the chessboard doubling ” 

Jan Gullberg writes, “With about 100 grains to a cubic centimeter, the total volume of 
[Sissa’s] wheat would be nearly... two hundred cubic kilometers, to be loaded on two

Harmonic Series Diverges 

Nicole Oresme (1323-1382), Pietro Mengoli (1626-1686), Johann Bernoulli 
(1667-1748), Jacob Bernoulli (1654—1705) 

If God were infinity, then divergent series would be His angels flying higher and higher 
to reach Him. Given an eternity, all such angels approach their Creator. For example, 

consider the following infinite series: 1+ 2+ 3 + 4_If we add one term of the series 

each year, in four years the sum will be 10. Eventually, after an infinite number of 
years, the sum reaches infinity. Mathematicians call such series divergent because they 
explode to infinity, given an infinite number of terms. For this entry, we are interested 
in a series that diverges much more slowly. We’re interested in a more magical series, an 
angel, perhaps, with weaker wings. 

Consider the harmonic series, the first famous example of a divergent series whose 
terms approach zero: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .... Of course, this series explodes more 
slowly than does our previous example, but it still grows to infinity. In fact, it grows so 
incredibly slowly that if we added a term a year, in 10 43 years we’d have a sum less than 
100. William Dunham writes, “Seasoned mathematicians tend to forget how surprising 
this phenomenon appears to the uninitiated student—that, by adding ever more 
negligible terms, we nonetheless reach a sum greater than any preassigned quantity.” 

Nicole Oresme, the famous French philosopher of the Middle Ages, was the first 
to prove the divergence of the harmonic series (c. 1350). His results were lost for several 
centuries, and the result was proved again by Italian mathematician Pietro Mengoli 
in 1647 and by Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli in 1687. His brother Jacob 
Bernoulli published a proof in his 1689 work Tractatus de Seriebus Infinitis (Treatise on 
Infinite Series), which he closes with: “So the soul of immensity dwells in minutia. And 
in narrowest limits no limits inhere. What joy to discern the minute in infinity! The vast 
to perceive in the small, what divinity!”

Law of Cosines 


Ghiyath al-Din Jams hid Mas’ud al-Kashi (c. 1380-1429), Francois Vi fete 
(1540-1603) 



The law of cosines may be used for calculating the length of one side of a triangle when 
the angle opposite this side, and the length of tire other two sides, are known. The law 
may be expressed as c 2 = a 2 + 6 2 - 2<z6cos(C), where a, b, and c are triangle side lengths, 
and C is an angle between sides a and b. Because of its generality, the application of the 
law ranges from land surveying to calculating the flight paths of aircraft. 

Notice how the law of cosines becomes die Pythagorean Theorem (c 2 = a 2 + fe 2 ) 
for right triangles, when C becomes 90° and the cosine becomes zero. Also note that if 
all three side lengths of a triangle are known, we can use the law of cosines to compute 
the angles of a triangle. 

Euclid’s Elements (c. 300 B.C.) contains the seeds of concepts that lead to the law 
of cosines. In the fifteenth century, the Persian astronomer and mathematician al-Kashi 
provided accurate trigonometric tables and expressed the theorem in a form suitable for 
modem usage. French mathematician Frangois Vifete discovered the law independently 
of al-Kashi. 

In French, the law of cosines is named Theor&me d’Al-Kashi, after al-Kashi’s 
unification of existing works on the subject. Al-Kashi’s most important work is The Key 
to Arithmetic, completed in 1427, which discusses mathematics used in 
astronomy, surveying, architecture, and accounting. Al-Kashi uses decimal 
fractions in calculating the total surface area needed for certain muqamas, 
decorative structures in Islamic and Persian architecture. 

Vifete had a fascinating life. At one point, he successfully broke the 
codes of Philip II of Spain for Henry IV of France. Philip believed that 
the very complex cipher could not be broken by mere men, and when he 
discovered that the French knew of his military plans, he complained to the 
Pope that black magic was being used against his country.

Treviso Arithmetic 


European arithmetic texts in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries often presented 
mathematical word problems related to commerce m order to teach mathematical 
concepts. The general idea of word problems for students dates back for centuries, and 
some of the oldest-known word problems were presented in ancient Egypt, China, 
and India. 

Treviso Arithmetic is brimming with word problems, many involving merchants 
investing money and who wish to avoid being cheated. The book was written in a 
Venetian dialect and published in 1478 in the town of Treviso, Italy. The unknown 
author of the book writes, “I have often been asked by certain youths in whom I have 
much interest, and who look forward to mercantile pursuits, to put into writing the 
fundamental principles of arithmetic. Therefore, being impelled by my affection for 
them, and by the value of the subject, I have to the best of my small ability undertaken 
to satisfy them m some slight degree.” He then gives numerous word problems involving 
merchants with names like Sebastiano and Jacomo who invest their money for gain 
in a partnership. The book also shows several ways for performing multiplication and 
includes information from the Fibonacci work Tiber Abaci (1202). 

Treviso is particularly significant because it is the earliest-known printed 
mathematics book in Europe. It also promoted the use of the Hindu Arabic numeral 
system and computational algorithms. Because commerce of the time began to have a 
wide international component, prospective businessmen had urgent needs to become 
facile with mathematics. Today, scholars are fascinated by Treviso because it provides a 
portal into the methods of teaching mathematics in fifteenth-century Europe. Similarly, 
because the problems involve calculating payment for exchanging goods, fabric cutting, 
saffron trading, alloy mixtures in coins, currency exchange, and calculating shares 
of profits derived from partnerships, readers come to understand the contemporary 
concerns with respect to cheating, usury, and determination of interest charges.

Discovery of Series Formula for TT 

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), James Gregory (1638-1675), 
Nilakantha Somayaji (1444-1544) 

An infinite series is the sum of infinitely many numbers, and it plays an important role 
in mathematics. For a series such as 1 + 2 + 3 +..., the sum is infinite, and the series is 
said to diverge. An alternating series is one in which every other term is negative. One 
particular alternating series has intrigued mathematicians for centuries. 

Pi, symbolized by the Greek letter 7r, is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to 
its diameter and can be expressed by a remarkably simple formula: tt/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 

1/5 - 1/7 + — Note also that the arctan function in trigonometry can be expressed 

by arctan(x) = x - x/3 + x/5 - x/7 + _Using the arctan series, the series for tt/ 4 is 

obtained by setting x = 1. 

Ranjan Roy notes that the independent discovery of the infinite series for tt “by 
different persons living in different environments and cultures gives us insight into 
the character of mathematics as a universal discipline.” The series was discovered 
by German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Scottish mathematician 
and astronomer James Gregory, and an Indian mathematician of the fourteenth or 
fifteenth century whose identity is not definitively known, although the result is usually 
ascribed to Nilakantha Somayaji. Leibniz discovered the formula in 1673, and Gregory 
discovered it in 1671. Roy writes, “Leibniz’s discovery of the infinite series for tt was 
Leibniz’s first greatest achievement.” Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens 
told Leibniz that this remarkable property of the circle would be celebrated among 
mathematicians forever. Even Newton said that the formula revealed Leibniz’s genius. 

Gregory’s discovery involving the arctan formula came before Leibniz, although 
Gregory did not note the special case of the arctan formula for tt/4. This arctan infinite 
series was also given in Somayaji’s 1500 book Tantrasangraha. Somayaji was aware that a 
finite series of rational numbers could never suffice to represent tt.

The number tt, which can be approximated by the digits shown in this illustration, also can be expressed by a 
remarkably simple formula tt/4 = I - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + . .. 





















Golden Ratio 


Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli (1445-1517) 

In 1509, Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli, a close friend of Leonardo da Vinci, 
published Divina Proportione, a treatise on a number that is now widely known as 
the “Golden Ratio.” This ratio, symbolized by 0, appears with amazing frequency in 
mathematics and nature. We can understand the proportion most easily by dividing a 
line into two segments so that die ratio of the whole segment to the longer part is the 
same as the ratio of the longer part to the shorter part, or (a + b)fb = bla =1.61803— 

If the lengths of the sides of a rectangle are in the golden ratio, then the rectangle is 
a “golden rectangle ” Ifs possible to divide a golden rectangle into a square and a golden 
rectangle. Next, we can cut the smaller golden rectangle into a smaller square and 

golden rectangle. We may continue this 
process indefinitely, producing smaller 
and smaller golden rectangles. 

If we draw a diagonal from the top 
right of the original rectangle to the bottom left, and then from the bottom right of the 
baby (that is, the next smaller) golden rectangle to the top left, the intersection point 
shows the point to which all the baby golden rectangles converge. Moreover, the lengths 
of the diagonals are in golden ratio to each another. The point to which all the golden 
rectangles converge is sometimes called the "Eye of God.” 

The golden rectangle is the only rectangle from which a square can be cut so that 
the remaining rectangle will always be similar to the original rectangle. If we connect 
the vertices in the diagram, we approximate a logarithmic spiral that “envelops” the Eye 
of God. Logarithmic spirals are everywhere—seashells, animal horns, the cochlea of the 
ear—anywhere nature needs to fill space economically and regularly. A spiral is strong 
and uses a minimum of materials. While expanding, it alters its sizfe but never its shape.

Rectangle (1925).

Polygraphiae Libri Sex 

Johannes Trithemius (1462-1516), Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Ishaq al-Sabbah 
Al-Kindi (c. 801-c. 873) 


Today, mathematical theory has become central to cryptography. However, in ancient 
times, simple substitution ciphers were often used in which letters in a message were 
replaced by other letters. For example, CAT becomes DBU when substituting each letter 
in CAT with the one following it in the alphabet Of course, such simple ciphers became 
easy to break after the discovery of frequency analysis, for example, by the Arab scholar 
al-Kindi in the ninth century. This method analyzes which letters occur most frequently in 
a language—such as ETAOIN SHRDLU in English—and uses this information to solve 
substitution codes. More complex statistics can be used, such as considering counts of 
pairs of letters. For example, Q almost always occurs together with U in English. 

The first printed book on cryptography, Polygraphiae Libri Sex (Six Books of 
Polygraphy), was written by German abbot Johannes Trithemius and published in 1518 
after his death. Polygraphiae contains hundreds of columns of Latin words, arranged in 
two columns per page. Each word stands for a letter of the alphabet For example, the 
first page starts like this: 

a: Deus a: clemens 

b: Creator b: clementissimus 

c: Conditor c: pius 

To encode a message, one uses a word to stand for a letter. Remarkably, Trithemius 
constructed the tables so that the coded passage appears to make sense as an actual 
prayer. For example, if the first two letters in a message were CA, the prayer would start 
with Conditor clemens (Merciful Creator) as the first two words in a Latin sentence. The 
remaining books of Polygraphiae present more sophisticated cryptographic methods, 
along with tables, for creatively hiding information. 

Trithemius's other famous work, Steganographia (written in 1499 and published 
in 1606), was placed on the Catholic Church’s “List of Prohibited Books” because it 
appeared to be a book about black magic, but in reality was just another code bookl

Loxodrome 


Pedro Nunes (1502-1578) 

For the purposes of terrestrial navigation, the loxodromic spiral—also known as a 
spherical helix, loxodrome, or rhumb line—goes through the north-south meridians 
of the Earth at a constant angle. The loxodrome coils like a gigantic snake around the 
Earth and spirals around the poles without reaching them. 

One way of sailing the Earth is to attempt to travel the shortest path between points, 
which is along an arc of a great circle around the Earth. However, even though this is 
the shortest path, a navigator must continually make adjustments to the course based on 
compass readings, a nearly impossible task for early navigators. 

On the other hand, a loxodromic path allows the navigator to continually direct 
the vessel to the same point of the compass even though the path to the destination is 
longer. For example, using this approach to travel from New York to London, a voyager 
could head at a constant bearing of 73° east of north. A loxodrome is represented as a 
straight line on a Mercator projection map. 

The loxodrome was invented by Portuguese mathematician and geographer Pedro 
Nunes. Nunes lived during a time when the Inquisition struck fear in the heart of 
Europe. Many Jews in Spain were forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism, and 
Nunes was converted as a child. The main targets of the later Spanish Inquisition were 
descendants of these conversos, such as Nunes’s grandsons in the early 1600s. Gerardus 
Mercator (1512-1594), a Flemish cartographer, was imprisoned by the Inquisition 
because of his Protestant faith and wide travels, and he narrowly escaped execution. 

Some Muslim groups in North America make use of a loxodrome line to Mecca 
(southeastward) as their qibla (praying direction) instead of using the traditional 
shortest path. In 2006, the Malaysian National Space Agency (MYNASA) sponsored a 
conference to determine the proper qibla for Muslims in orbit.

projection to a loxodrome curve. (A stenographic projection maps a sphere onto a plane.) 




















Cardano s Ars Magna 

Gerolamo Cardano (1501-1576), Niccolo Taxtaglia (1500-1557), 

Lodovico Ferrari (1522-1565) 

Italian Renaissance mathematician, physician, astrologer, and gambler Gerolamo 
Cardano is most famous for his work on algebra titled Artis magnae, sive de regulis 
algebraicis (Of the Great Art, or The Rules of Algebra) —also referred to more succinctly 
as Ars magna. Although the book sold well, Jan Gullberg notes, “No single publication 
has promoted interest in algebra like Cardano’s Ars magna, which, however, provides 
very boring reading to a present-day peruser by consistently devoting pages of verbose 
rhetoric to a solution.... With the untiring industry of an organ grinder, Cardano 
monotonously reiterates the same solution for a dozen or more near-identical problems 
where just one would do." 

Nevertheless, Cardano’s impressive work revealed solutions to different types 
of cubic and quartic equations—that is, equations with variables raised to the third 
and fourth powers, respectively. Italian mathematician Niccolo Tartaglia had earlier 
communicated to Cardano the solution to the cubic, x 5 4 ■ ax = b, and he attempted to 
ensure that Cardano would never publish the solution by making Cardano swear an 
oath to God. Cardano published the solution anyway, after he seemed to discover that 
Tartaglia was not the first to solve the cubic equation using radicals. The general quartic 
equation was solved by Cardano’s student Lodovico Ferrari. 

In Ars magna, Cardano explored the existence of what are now called imaginary 
numbers, which are based on the square root of—1, although he did not fully appreciate 
their properties. In fact, he presents the first calculation with complex numbers when 
he writes: “Dismissing mental tortures, and multiplying 5 + /-15 by 5 —V -15, we 
obtain 25 - (-15). Therefore, the product is 40.” 

In 1570, as a result of the Inquisition, Cardano was thrown in jail for several months 
on the charge of heresy, because he had cast the horoscope of Jesus Christ. According 
to legend, Cardano correctly predicted the exact date of his own death, a prophecy he is 
said to have ensured by killing himself on this date.

Sumario Compendioso 

Juan Diez (1480-1549) 

The Sumario compendioso, published in Mexico City in 1556, is the first work on 
mathematics printed in die Americas. The publication of Sumario compendioso in the 
New World preceded by many decades the emigration of the Puritans to North America 
and the settlement in Jamestown, Virginia. The author, Brother Juan Diez, was a 
companion of Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, during Cortes's conquests of 
the Aztec Empire. 

Diez wrote the book primarily for people buying gold and silver recovered from the 
mines of Peru and Mexico. In addition to providing tables to make it easy for merchants 
to obtain numerical values without much calculation, he also devoted part of the work 
to algebra related to the quadratic equation—that is, equations of the form ax 2 + bx + c 
= 0 with <2^0. For example, one of the problems may be translated as: “Find the square 
from which if 1554 is subtracted, the result is its own root” This is equivalent to solving 
x 1 - 1554 = x. 

The full title of Diez’s work is Sumario compendioso de las quentas de plata y oro 
que in los reynos del Pirn son necessarias a los mercaderes y todo genero de tratantes los 
algunas reglas tocantes al Arithmetica, which translates to Comprehensive Summary 
of the Counting of Silver and Gold, Which, in the Kingdoms of Peru, Are Necessary 
for Merchants and All Kinds of Traders. The printing press and paper were shipped 
from Spain and then carried to Mexico City. Only four known copies of Sumario 
compendioso exist today. 

According to Shirley Gray and C. Edward Sandifer, “The New World's first 
mathematics book in English was not published until 1703.... Of all the colonial 
mathematics books, the ones in Spanish are the most interesting, because they were 
mostly written in America for use by people living in America."

Mercator Projection 

Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594), Edward Wright (c. 1558-1615) 

Many of the ancient Greek ideas for representing a spherical Earth on a flat map were 
lost during the Middle Ages. John Short explains that, in the fifteenth century, “the 
value of sea charts rivaled gold as a primary target for buccaneer captains. Later, maps 
became status symbols among wealthy merchants who built vast fortunes thanks to 
thriving trade routes made possible by reliable sea navigation." 

One of the most famous map projections in history is the Mercator map (1569), 
which became commonly used for nautical voyages and is named after Flemish carto¬ 
grapher Gerardus Mercator. Norman Thrower writes, “Like several other projections, 
the Mercator is conformal (shapes around a point are correct), but it also has a unique 
property: straight lines are rhumb lines or loxodromes (lines of constant compass 
bearing).” This latter quality was invaluable to marine navigators who chose routes using 
compasses and other devices to indicate geographical directions and to steer the ships. 
The use of the Mercator map increased in the 1700s, after the invention of the accurate 
marine chronometer, a timekeeping device used to determine longitude by means of 
celestial navigation. 

Although Mercator was the first mapmaker to create his projection in which 
compass lines intersect meridians at a constant, given angle, he probably used graphical 
methods and little mathematics. English mathematician Edward Wright provided an 
analysis of the fascinating properties of the map in his Certaine Errors in Navigation 
(1599). For the mathematically inclined reader, the Mercator map projection with x and 
y coordinates may be created from latitude <p and longitude X values by- x = X - Xq and 
y = sinh -1 (tan(cp)), where Xq is the longitude at the center of the map. The Mercator 
projection does have its imperfections; for example, it exaggerates the size of areas far 
from the equator. 

SEE ALSO Loxodrome (1537), Projective Geometry (1639), and Three-Armed Protractor (1801).

The Mercator map has been commonly used for nautical voyages However, the map creates distortions. 

For example, Greenland appears to be roughly the same as Africa, even though Africa’s area is 14 times that 
of Greenland. 






Imaginary Numbers 

Rafael Bombelli (1526-1572) 

An imaginary number is one whose square has a negative value. The great mathema¬ 
tician Gottfried Leibniz called imaginary numbers “a wonderful flight of God's Spirit; 
they are almost an amphibian between being and not being.” Because the square of any 
real number is positive, for centuries many mathematicians declared it impossible for a 
negative number to have a square root Although various mathematicians had inklings 
of imaginary numbers, the history of imaginary numbers started to blossom in sixteenth- 
centuiy Europe. The Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli, well known during his time for 
draining swamps, is today famous for his Algebra, published m 1572, that introduced 
a notation for f-l , which would be a valid solution to the equation x 2 + 1 = 0. He 
wrote, “It was a wild thought in the judgment of many.” Numerous mathematicians 
were hesitant to “believe” in imaginary numbers, including Descartes, who actually 
introduced the term imaginary as a kind of insult. 

Leonhard Euler in the eighteenth century introduced the symbol i for /—T —for 
the first letter of the Latin word imaginarius —and we still use Euler’s symbol today. Key 
advances in modem physics would not have been possible without the use of imaginary 
numbers, which have aided physicists in a vast range of computations, including 
efficient calculations involving alternating currents, relativity theory, signal processing, 
fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics. Imaginary numbers even play a role in the 
production of gorgeous fractal artworks that show a wealth of detail with increasing 
magnifications. 

From string theory to quantum theory, the deeper one studies physics, the closer 
one moves to pure mathematics. Some might even say that mathematics “runs” reality 
in the same way that Microsoft’s operating system runs a computer. Schrodinger s wave 
equation—which describes basic reality and events in terms of wave functions and 
probabilities—may be thought of as the evanescent substrate on which we all exist, and 
it relies on imaginary numbers.

Hypothesis (1859), Boole's Philosophy and Fun of Algebra (1909), and Fractals (1975)

Imaginary numbers play a role in the production of Jos Leys's gorgeous fractal artworks that show a wealth of 
detail with increasing magnifications. Early mathematicians were so suspicious of the usefulness of imaginary 
numbers that they insulted those who suggested their existence.

Kepler Conjecture 

Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), Thomas Callister Hales (1740-1780) 

Imagine that your goal is to fill a large box with as many golf balls as possible. Close the 
lid tightly when finished. The density of balls is determined from the proportion of the 
volume of the box that contains a ball. In order to stuff the most balls into the box, you 
need to discover an arrangement with the highest possible density. If you simply drop 
balls into the box, you’ll only achieve a density of roughly 65 percent If you are careful, 
and create a layer at the bottom in a hexagonal arrangement and then put the next layer 
of balls in die indentations created by the bottom layer, and continue, you'll be able to 
achieve a packing density of 'ir//l8, which is about 74 percent 

In 1611, German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote that no 
other arrangement of balls has a higher average density. In particular, he conjectured in 
his monograph The Six-Comered Snowflake that it is impossible to pack identical spheres 
in three dimensions greater than the packing found in free-centered (hexagonal) cubic 
packing. In the nineteenth century, Karl Friedrich Gauss proved that the traditional 
hexagonal arrangement was the most efficient for a regular 3-D grid. Nevertheless, the 
Kepler conjecture remained, and ho one was sure if a denser packing could be achieved 
with an irregular packing. 

Finally, in 1998, American mathematician Thomas Hales stunned the world when 
he presented a proof that Kepler had been right. Hales’s equation and its 150 variables 
expressed every conceivable arrangement of 50 spheres. Computers confirmed that no 
combination of variables led to a packing efficiency higher than 74 percent. 

The Annals of Mathematics agreed to publish the proof, provided it was accepted by 
a panel of 12 referees. In 2003, the panel reported that they were “99 percent certain” 
of the correctness of the proof. Hales estimates that to produce a complete formal proof 
will take around 20 years of work.

Fascinated by Keplers famous conjecture, Princeton University scientists Paul Chaikin, Salvatore Torquato, 
and colleagues studied the packing of M&M chocolate candies. They discovered that the candies had a packing 
density of about 68 percent, or 4 percent greater than for randomly packed spheres. 








Logarithms 

John Napier (1550-1617) 


Scottish mathematician John Napier is famous as the inventor and promoter of 
logarithms in his 1614 book A Description of the Marvelous Rule of Logarithms. This 
method has since contributed to countless advances in science and engineering by 
making difficult calculations possible. Before electronic calculators became widely 
available, logarithms and tables of logarithms were commonly used in surveying 
and navigation. Napier was also the inventor of Napier’s bones, rods carved with 
multiplication tables that could be arranged in patterns in order to aid in calculations. 

A logarithm (to a base b) of a number x is expressed as loga(x) and equals the 
exponent y that satisfies x = b y . For example, because 3 5 = 3x3x3x3x3 = 243, we 
say that the log of 243 (base 3) is 5, or log3(243) = 5. As another example, logjo(lOO) = 

2. For practical purposes, consider that a multiplication such as 8 x 16 = 128 can be 
rewritten as 2} x 2 4 = 2 7 , thereby converting the calculations into ones involving the 
simple additions of the powers (3 + 4 = 7). Prior to calculators, in order to multiply two 
numbers, an engineer often looked up the logarithms of both numbers in a table, added 
them, and then looked up the result in the table to find the product This could often be 
faster than multiplying by hand and is the principle on which slide rules are based. 

Today, various quantities and scales in science are expressed as logarithms of other 
quantities. For example, the pH scale in chemistry, the bel unit of measurement in 
acoustics, and the Richter scale used for measuring earthquake intensity all involve a 
base-10 logarithmic scale. Interestingly, the discovery of logarithms just prior to the era 
of Isaac Newton had an impact on science comparable to the invention of the computer 
in the twentieth century.

John Napier, the discoverer of logarithms, created a calculation device known as Napier’s rods or bones. Napier's 
rotatable rods reduced rrmltiplicatton to a sequence of simple additions.

Slide Rule 


William Oughtred (1574-1660) 


Those of you who went to high school before the 1970s may recall that the slide rule 
once seemed to be as common as the typewriter. In just seconds, engineers could 
multiply, divide, find square roots, and do much more. The earliest version with sliding 
pieces was invented in 1621 by English mathematician and Anglican minister William 
Oughtred, based on the logarithms of Scottish mathematician John Napier. Oughtred 
may not have initially recognized the value of his work, because he did not quickly 
publish his findings. According to some accounts, one of his students stole the idea and 
published a pamphlet on the slide rule, which emphasized its portability, and raved 
that the device was “fit for use on horseback as on foot” Oughtred was outraged by his 
student’s duplicity. 

In 1850, a 19-year-old French artillery lieutenant modified the original design of 
the slide rule, and the French army used it to perform projectile calculations when 
fighting the Prussians. During World War II, American bombers often used specialized 
slide rules. 

Slide-rule guru Cliff Stoll writes, “Consider the engineering achievements that owe 
their existence to rubbing two sticks together: the Empire State Building; the Hoover 
Dam; the curves of the Golden Gate Bridge; hydrodynamic automobile transmissions, 
transistor radios; the Boeing 707 airliner ” Wemher Von Braun, the designer of the 
German V-2 rocket, relied on slide rules made by the German company Nestler, as 
did Albert Einstein. Pickett slide rules were aboard Apollo space missions in case the 
computers failedl 

In the twentieth century, 40 million slide rules were produced worldwide. Given 
the cmcial role that this device played from the Industrial Revolution until modem 
times, the device deserves a place in this book. Literature from the Oughtred Society 
states, “For a span of 3.5 centuries, it was used to perform design calculations for 
virtually all the major structures built on this earth.”

Fermats Spiral 

Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), Ren6 Descartes (1596-1650) 


In the early 1600s, Pierre de Fermat, a French lawyer and mathematician, made brilliant 
discoveries in number theory and other areas of mathematics. His 1636 manuscript “Ad 
locos pianos et solidos lisagoge ” (“Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci”) went beyond 
Rene Descartes’ work in analytical geometry and allowed Fermat to define and study 
many important curves that included the cycloid and the Fermat spiral. 

The Fermat spiral, or parabolic spiral, can be created using the polar equation r 2 = 
a 1 6. Here, r is file distance of the curve from the origin, a is a constant that determines 
how tightly wound the spiral is, and 6 is the polar angle. For any given positive value 
of 0, negative and positive values for r exist which leads to a curve that is symmetrical 
about the origin. Fermat studied the relationship of the area enclosed by an arm of the 
spiral and the x-axis as the spiral turns. 

Today, computer graphics specialists sometimes use this curve to model the 
arrangement of seed heads in flowers. For example, we may draw spots that have center 
positions determined by polar coordinate values, r(j) = kr^, and angles 6 defined by 6{i) 
- Htt/t. Here, t is the golden number (1+fS)fl, and i is simply a counter that steps as 
1,2, 3,4,... 

This graphics approach produces many different spiral arms that twist in one 
direction or another. It is possible to trace various sets of symmetrical spirals, radiating 
from the center of the pattern, for example a set of 8, 13, or 21 spiral arms, and these 
numbers of arms are all Fibonacci numbers (see entry Fibonacci’s Liber Abaci). 

Michael Mahoney writes, “Fermat had been working with spirals for some time 
before he encountered one in Galileo’s Dialogue. In a letter of June 3, 1636, he 
described to Mersenne the spiral r 2 = a 2 6 ....” 

SEE ALSO Archimedes' Spiral (225 B C.), Fibonacci's Liber Abaci (1202), Goldeh Ratio (1509), Loxodrome 
(1537), Fermat's Last Theorem (1637), Logarithmic Spiral (1638), Voderberg Tilings (1936), Ulam Spiral 
(1963), and Spidrons (1979).

The Fermat spiral^ or parabolic &piral f can be created using the polar equation r 2 = a^0 For any given positive 
value ofQ, two values for r exist , which leads to a curve that is symmetrical about the origin „ which is located at 
the center of this artistic rendition 









Fermat’s Last Theorem 


Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), Andrew John Wiles (b. 1953), Johann 
Dirichlet (1805- 1859), Gabriel Lame (1795-1870) 

In the early 1600s, Pierre de Fermat, a French lawyer, made brilliant discoveries in 
number theory. Although he was an "amateur” mathematician, he created mathematical 
challenges such as Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT), which was not solved until 1994 by 
British-American mathematician Andrew Wiles. Wiles spent seven years of his life trying 
to prove the famous theorem, which may have generated more attempts at proofs than 
any other theorem. 

FLT states thatx” + y” = z n has no non-zero integer solutions forx, y, and z when 
n > 2. Fermat stated his theorem in 1637 when he wrote in his copy of Diophantus’s 
Arithmetica, "I have a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too 
narrow to contain ” Today, we believe that Fermat had no such proof. 

Fermat was no ordinary lawyer, indeed. He is considered, along with Blaise 
Pascal (1623-1662), the founder of probability theory. As the co-inventor of analytic 
geometry, along with Ren£ Descartes (1596—1650), he is regarded as one of the 
first modern mathematicians. He once pondered if it was possible to find a right 
triangle whose hypotenuse and sums of legs were squares. Today, we know that the 
smallest three numbers satisfying these conditions are quite large: 4,565,486,027,761, 
1,061,652,293,520, and 4,687,298,610,289. 

Since Fermat’s time, FLT has spawned significant mathematical research and 
completely new methods. In 1832, Johann Dirichlet published a proof of Fermat’s Last 
Theorem for n = 14. Gabriel Lame proved it for n - 7 in 1839. Amir Aczel writes that 
FLT “would become the world’s most baffling mathematical mystery. Simple, elegant, 
and [seemingly] utterly impossible to prove, Fermat’s Last Theorem captured the 
imaginations of amateur and professional mathematicians for over three centuries. For 
some it became a wonderful passion. For others it was an obsession that led to deceit, 
intrigue, or insanity.”

Descartes’ La Geometrie 


Rene Descartes (1596-1650) 

In 1637, French philosopher and mathematician Ren6 Descartes published La 
gdometrie, which shows how geometrical shapes and figures can be analyzed using 
algebra. Descartes’ work influenced the evolution of analytical geometry, a field of 
mathematics that involves the representation of positions in a coordinate system and 
in which mathematicians algebraically analyze such positions. La gdomdtrie also shows 
how to solve mathematical problems and discusses the representation of points of a 
plane through the use of real numbers, and the representation and classification of 
curves through the use of equations. 

Interestingly, La geomdtrie does not actually use “Cartesian” coordinate axes or any 
other coordinate system. The book pays as much attention to representing algebra in 
geometric forms as vice versa. Descartes believed that algebraic steps in a proof should 
usually correspond to a geometrical representation. 

Jan Gullberg writes, “La geometrie is the earliest mathematical text that a modern 
student of mathematics could read without stumbling over an abundance of obsolete 
notations... .Along with Newton’s Principia, it is one of the most influential scientific 
texts of the seventeenth century.” According to Carl Boyer, Descartes desired to “free 
geometry” from the use of diagrams through algebraic procedures and to give meaning 
to the operations of algebra through geometric inteipretation. 

More generally, Descartes was groundbreaking in his proposal to unite algebra and 
geometry into a single subject Judith Grabiner writes, "Just as the history of Western 
philosophy has been viewed as a series of footnotes to Plato, so the past 350 years of 
mathematics can be viewed as a series of footnotes to Descartes’ Geometry ... and the 
triumph of Descartes’ methods of problem solving.” 

Boyer concludes, "In terms of mathematical ability, Descartes probably was the most 
able thinker of his day, but he was at heart not really a mathematician.” His geometry was 
only one facet of a full life that revolved around science, philosophy, and religion.

Cardioid 


Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528), Etienne Pascal (1588-1640), Ole R0mer (1644- 
1710), Philippe de La Hire (1640-1718), Johann Castillon (1704-1791) 

The heart-shaped cardioid has fascinated mathematicians for centuries due bo its 
mathematical properties, graphic beauty, and practical applications. The curve can 
be produced simply by tracking a point on a circle as it rolls around on another (fixed) 
circle of the same radius. The name is derived from the Greek word for heart, and its 
polar equation maybe written as r = a(\ - cos 6). The area of the cardioid is (3/2 )tt a 2 , 
and its perimeter is 8 a. 

Tire cardioid may also be generated by drawing a circle C and fixing a point P on 
it. Next, draw a set of various circles centered on the circumference of C and passing 
through P. These circles trace out a cardioid shape. The cardioid appears in a wide 
range of seemingly disparate mathematical areas, from the caustics in the field of optics 
to the central shape of the Mandelbrot Set in fractal geometry. 

Many dates may be associated with the cardioid. French lawyer and amateur 
mathematician Etienne Pascal, father of mathematician Blaise Pascal, formally 
studied the more general case of the curve, called the Lima^on of Pascal, around 
1637. However, even earlier, German painter and mathematician Albrecht Diirer 
provided a method for drawing the Limagon in Underweysung der Messung 
(Instruction in Measurement), published in 1525. In 1674, Danish astronomer Ole 
Rpmer contemplated the cardioid when considering shapes for gear teeth. French 
mathematician Philippe de La Hire determined its length in 1708. Interestingly, the 
cardioid was not given its evocative name until 1741, when Johann Castillon named it 
in his treatise in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. 

Glen Vecchione explains the practical side of cardioids, when he writes that they 
can show "the interference and congruence patterns of waves that radiate concentrically 
from a point source. In doing so, they can identify die areas of greatest sensitivity on 
microphones or antennas.... A cardioid microphone is sensitive to front sound and 
minimizes rear sound.”

A cardioid form is traced out by straight lines that connect one point of a circle to another, the front end of the 
line going twice as fast around the circle as the rear end. (This rendering is by Jos Leys.) 














Logarithmic Spiral 

Ren6 Descartes (1596-1650), Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) 


Logarithmic spirals in nature are ubiquitous and have a range of botanical and 
zoological manifestations. Probably the most common examples are the logarithmic 
spirals of nautilus shells and other seashells, the horns of a variety of mammals, the 
arrangement of seeds of many plants (such as the sunflower and daisy), and the scales of 
a pinecone. Martin Gardner has noted that Eperia , a common variety of spider, spins a 
web in which a strand coils around the center in a logarithmic spiral 

The logarithmic spiral (also known as the equiangular spiral or Bernoulli spiral) can 
be expressed as r = ke a ^, where r is tire distance from the origin. The angle 0 between a 
tangent line to the curve and a radial line drawn to (r, 0) is constant. The spiral was first 
discussed by French mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes in 1638 in letters 
written to French theologian and mathematician Marin Meisenne. Later, the spiral was 
studied more extensively by Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli. 

The most impressive appearance of the logarithmic spiral is in the huge arms 
of many galaxies, and the traditional view is that it is necessary to have a long-range 
interaction like gravity to create such vast order. In spiral galaxies, the spiral arms are 
sites of active star formation. 

Spiral patterns often occur spontaneously in matter that is organized through 
symmetry transformations: change of size (growth) and rotation. Form follows function, 
and the spiral form can allow for the compaction of a relatively long length. Long 
yet compact tubes are useful in mollusks and cochleas for obvious reasons, including 
physical strength and increased surface area. As a member of a species grows to maturity, 
it generally transforms in such a way that its parts maintain approximately the same 
proportion with respect to each other, and this is probably a reason why nature often 
exhibits self-similar spiral growth.

Spiral (1963), and Spidrons (1979)

of which can grow to 30 or more in adult creatures 









Projective Geometry 

Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472), Gerard Desargues (1591-1661), 
Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867) 

Projective geometry generally concerns die relationships between shapes and their 
mappings, or “images,” that result from projecting the shapes onto a surface. Projections 
may often be visualized as the shadows cast by objects. 

The Italian architect Leon Battista Alberti was one of the first individuals to experi¬ 
ment with projective geometry through his interest in perspective in art. More generally, 
Renaissance artists and architects were concerned with methods for representing three- 
dimensional objects in two-dimensional drawings. Alberti sometimes placed a glass screen 
between himself and the landscape, closed one eye, and marked on the glass certain 
points that appeared to be in the image. The resulting 2-D drawing gave a faithful 
impression of the 3-D scene. 

French mathematician Gerard Desargues was the first professional mathematician 
to formalize projective geometry while searching for ways to extend Euclidean geometry. 
In 1636, Desargues published Exemple de Vune des manieres universelles du S.G.D.L. 
touchant la pratique de la perspective (Example of a Universal Method by Sieur Girard 
Desargues Lyonnais Concerning the Practice of Perspective), in which he presented 
a geometric method for constructing perspective images of objects. Desargues also 
examined the properties of shapes that were preserved under perspective mappings. 
Painters and engravers made use of his approach. 

Desargues’ most important work, Brouillon project d'une atteinte aux evenements des 
rencontres dun c6ne avec un plan (Rough Draft of Attaining the Outcome of Intersecting 
a Cone with a Plane), published in 1639, treats the theory of conic sections using projec¬ 
tive geometry. In 1882, French mathematician and engineer Jean-Victor Poncelet 
(1788—1867) published a treatise that revitalized interest in projective geometry. 

In projective geometry, elements such as points, lines, and planes generally remain 
points, lines, and planes when projected. However, lengths, ratios of lengths, and angles 
may change under projection. In projective geometry, parallel lines in Euclidean 
geometry intersect at infinity in the projection.

Torricelli s Trumpet 

Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) 

Your friend hands you a gallon of red paint and asks how you would completely paint 
an infinite surface with this gallon of paint What surface would you choose? Many 
possible answers to this question exist, but Torricelli’s trumpet is one famous shape 
to consider—a hornlike object created by revolving f{x) = 1/x for x e of [1, °°) about 
the x-axis. Standard calculus methods can be used to demonstrate that the Torricelli’s 
trumpet has finite volume but infinite surface area! 

John dePillis explains that, mathematically speaking, pouring red paint into the 
Torricelli’s trumpet could fill the funnel and, in so doing, you could paint the entire 
interior infinite surface, even though you have a finite number of paint molecules. This 
seeming paradox can be partly resolved by remembering that the Torricelli’s trumpet is 
actually a mathematical construct, and our finite number of paint molecules that “fills” 
the hom is an approximation to the actual finite volume of the hom. 

For what values of a does f(x) — 1/x* 7 produce a hom with finite volume and infinite 
area? This is something for you to ponder with your mathematical friends. 

Torricelli’s trumpet is sometimes called Gabriel’s hom and is named after Italian 
physicist and mathematician Evangelista Torricelli, who discovered it in 1641. He was 
astounded by this trumpet that seemed to be an infinitely long solid with an infinite- 
area surface and a finite volume. Torricelli and his colleagues thought that it was a deep 
paradox and unfortunately did not have the tools of calculus to fully appreciate and 
understand the object Today, Torricelli is remembered for the telescopic astronomy 
he did with Galileo and for his invention of the barometer. The name “Gabriel’s hom” 
conjures visions of Archangel Gabriel blowing his hom to announce Judgment Day, 
thereby associating the infinite with the powers of God.

Pascals Triangle 


Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) 

One of the most famous integer patterns in the history of mathematics is Pascal's 
triangle. Blaise Pascal was the first to write a treatise about this progression in 1654, 
although the pattern had been lcnown by the Persian poet and mathematician Omar 
Khayyam as far back as A.D. 1100, and even earlier to the mathematicians of India and 
ancient China. The first seven rows of Pascal’s triangle are depicted at upper right 
Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two above it Mathematicians have 
discussed the role that Pascal’s triangle plays in probability theory, in the expansion of 
binomials of the form (x + y) n , and in various number theory applications for years. 
Mathematician Donald Knuth (b. 1938) once indicated that there are so many relations 
and patterns in Pascals triangle that when someone finds a new identity, there aren’t 
many people who get excited about it anymore, except the discoverer. Nonetheless, 
fascinating studies have revealed coundess wonders, including special geometric 
patterns in the diagonals, the existence of perfect square patterns with various hexagonal 

properties, and an extension of the triangle and its patterns to 
negative integers and to higher dimensions. 

When even numbers in the triangle are replaced by dots 
and odd numbers by gaps, the resulting pattern is a fractal, 
with intricate repeating patterns on different size scales. These 
fractal figures may have a practical importance in that they 
can provide models for materials scientists to help produce 
new structures with novel properties. For example, in 1986, 
researchers created wire gaskets on the micron size scale 
almost identical to Pascal's triangle, with holes for the odd 
numbers. The area of their smallest triangle was about 1.38 
microns squared, and the scientists investigated many unusual 
properties of their superconducting gasket in a magnetic field.

The Length of Neile’s 
Semicubical Parabola 

William Neile (1637-1670), John Wallis (1616-1703) 


In 1657, British mathematician William Neile became the first person to "rectify,” 
or find the arc length of, a nontrivial algebraic curve. This special curve is called a 
semicubical parabola, defined by x 3 = ay 2 . When written as y = it ox 3/2 , it is easier to 
see how it might have been considered “half a cubic” and hence the genesis of the term 
semicubic. A report of Neile s work appeared in British mathematician John Wallis’s De 
Cycloide in 1659. Interestingly, only the arc lengths of transcendental curves, such as 
the logarithmic spiral and cycloid, had been calculated before 1659. 

Because attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola were unsuccessful, some 
mathematicians, such as French philosopher and mathematician Rend Descartes 
(1596-1650), had conjectured that few curves could be rectified. 
However, Italian physicist and mathematician Evangelista Torricelli 
(1608-1647) rectified the logarithmic spiral, which was the first curved 
line (other than the circle) whose length was determined. The cycloid 
was the next curve rectified, by English geometer and architect Sir 
Christopher Wren (1632-1723) in 1658. 

Around 1687, Dutch mathematician and physicist Christiaan 
Huygens (1629-1695) showed that the semicubical parabola is a curve 
along which a particle may descend under the force of gravity so that it 
moves equal vertical distances in equal times. The semicubical parabola 
can also be expressed as a pair of equations: x = t L and y = <zf 3 . Given 
this form, the length of the curve as a function of t is (1/27) x (4 + 9t 2 ) 3/2 - 8/27. In 
other words, the curve has this length on the interval from 0 to t. In the literature, we 
sometimes see Neile’s parabola referred to as the curve for y 3 = ax 1 , which places the 
cusp of the curve pointing downward along the y-axis instead of to the left on the x-axis.

Viviani’s Theorem 


Vincenzo Viviani (1622-1703) 

Place a point inside an equilateral triangle. From this point, draw a line to each of the 
sides so that these three lines are perpendicular to each side. No matter where you 
placed your point, (he sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides is 
equal to the height of the triangle. The theorem is named after Italian mathematician 
and scientist Vincenzo Viviani. Galileo was so impressed by Viviani’s talent that he took 
him into his house in Arcetri, Italy, as a collaborator. 

Researchers have found ways to extend Viviani’s theorem to problems in which 
the point is placed outside the triangle and have also explored the application of the 
theorem to any regular n-sided polygon. In this case, the sum of the perpendicular 
distances from an interior point to (he n sides is n times the apothem of the polygon. (An 
apothem is the distance from (he center to a side.) The theorem can also be studied in 
higher dimensions. 

When Galileo died, Viviani wrote Galileo’s biography and hoped to publish a 
complete edition of Galileo’s works. Alas, the Church prohibited this effort, which hurt 
Vivianis reputation and was a blow to science in general. Viviani published the Italian 
version of Euclid’s Elements in 1690. 

Not only is the theorem interesting mathematically due to its numerous different 
proofs, the theorem is used for teaching children various aspects of geometry. Some 
teachers have placed the problem in a real-world setting by casting it in the context of a 
surfer stranded on an island in the shape of an equilateral triangle. The surfer wants to 
build a hut where the sum of the distances to the sides is a minimum, because she surfs 
on each of the three beaches an equal amount of time. Students are intrigued to learn 
that the placement of the hut does not matter.

Discovery of Calculus 

Isaac Newton (1642-1727), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) 


English mathematician Isaac Newton and German mathematician Gottfried 
Wilhelm Leibniz are usually credited with the invention of calculus, but various 
earlier mathematicians explored the concept of rates and limits, starting with the 
ancient Egyptians who developed rules for calculating the volume of pyramids and 
approximating the areas of circles. 

In the 1600s, both Newton and Leibniz puzzled over problems of tangents, rates 
of change, minima, maxima, and infinitesimals (unimaginably tiny quantities that 
are almost but not quite zero). Both men understood that differentiation (finding the 
tangent to a curve at a point—that is, a straight line that "just touches” the curve at that 
point) and integration (finding the area under a curve) are inverse processes. Newton’s 
discovery (1665—1666) started with his interest in infinite sums; however, he was slow to 
publish his findings. Leibniz published his discovery of differential calculus in 1684 and 
of integral calculus in 1686. He said, “It is unworthy of excellent men, to lose hours like 

slaves in the labor of calculation_My new calculus ... offers truth by a kind of analysis 

and without any effort of imagination ” Newton was outraged. Debates raged for many 
years on how to divide the credit for the discovery of calculus, and, as a result, progress 
in calculus was delayed. Newton was the first to apply calculus to problems in physics, 
and Leibniz developed much of the notation seen in modem calculus books. 

Today, calculus has invaded every field of scientific endeavor and plays invaluable 
roles in biology, physics, chemistry, economics, sociology, and engineering, and in any 
field where some quantity, like speed or temperature, changes. Calculus can be used to 
help explain the structure of a rainbow, teach us how to make more money in the stock 
market, guide a spacecraft, make weather forecasts, predict population growth, design 
buildings, and analyze the spread of diseases. Calculus has caused a revolution. It has 
changed the way we look at the world.

Newton's Method 


Isaac Newton (1642-1727) 

The use of computational techniques based on recurrence relationships, in which each 
term of a sequence is defined as a function of the preceding term, can be traced back to 
the dawn of mathematics. The Babylonians used such techniques to compute the square 
root of a positive number, and the Greeks to approximate pi. Today, many important 
special functions of mathematical physics may be computed by recurrence formulas. 

Numerical analysis is often concerned with obtaining approximate solutions to 
difficult problems. Newton’s method is one of the most famous numerical methods for 
solving equations of the form f(x) = 0, some solutions of which may be difficult to 
find using simple algebraic methods. The problem of finding the zeros, or roots, of a 
function by these kinds of methods occurs frequently in science and engineering. 

To apply Newton’s method, one starts with a numerical guess for the solution of 
the root, and then the function is approximated by its tangent line, which is a straight 
line that “just touches” the graph of the function at a point. After determining the 
x-intercept of this line, which is often a better approximation to the nearby root than 
the initial guess, the method can be iterated (repeated) to produce successively accurate 
approximations. The precise formula for Newton’s method is x n + i = x„ — f(x n )/f'(x n ), 
where the prime symbol (') indicates the first derivative of the function f. 

When the method is applied to functions with complex values, computer graphics 
renditions are sometimes used to give an indication of where the method can be relied 
upon and where it behaves strangely. The resulting graphics often reveal chaotic 
behavior and beautiful fractal patterns. 

The mathematical seeds for Newton’s method were described by Isaac Newton 
in De anahysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas (On Analysis by Equations 
with an Infinite Number of Terms), written in 1669 and published by William Jones 
in 1711. In 1740, British mathematician Thomas Simpson refined the approach and 
described Newton's method as an iterative method for solving general nonlinear equations 
using calculus.

Computer graphics can be useful for revealing the intricate behavior of Newtons method when applied to finding 
the complex-number roots of an equation. Paul Nylander generated this image by employing the method in order 
to find the solutions of 7? - 1 = 0 










Tautochrone Problem 


Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) 

In the 1600s, mathematicians and physicists sought a curve that specified the shape 
of a special kind of ramp. In particular, objects are placed on the ramp, one at a time, 
and they must slide down to the very bottom, always in the same amount of time and 
no matter where they start on the ramp. The objects are accelerated by gravity, and the 
ramp is considered to have no friction. 

Dutch mathematician, astronomer, and physicist Christiaan Huygens discovered 
a solution in 1673 and published it in his Horologium oscillatoriumi (The Pendulum 
Clock). Technically speaking, the tautochrone is a cycloid—that is, a curve defined by 
the path of a point on the edge of a circle as the circle rolls along a straight line. The 
tautochrone is also called the brachistochrone when referring to the curve that gives a 
frictionless object the fastest rate of descent when the object slides down from one point 
to another. 

Huygens attempted to use his discovery to design a more accurate pendulum clock. 
The clock made use of portions of tautochrone surfaces near where the string pivoted 
to ensure that the string followed the optimum curve no matter where the pendulum 
started swinging. (Alas, the friction due to the surfaces introduced significant errors.) 

The special property of the tautochrone is mentioned in Moby Dick in a discussion 
on a try-pot, a bowl used for rendering blubber to produce oil: “[The try-pot] is also 
a place for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left-hand try-pot of the 
Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck 
by the remarkable feet, that in geometry all bodies gliding along a cycloid, my soapstone, 
for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.”

Under the influence of gravity, three balk run along the tautochrone curve starting from different positions, yet 
the balk will arrive at the bottom at the same time. (The balls are placed on the ramp f one at a time.) 




Astroid 



Ole Christensen R0mer (1644-1710) 

The astroid is a curve with four cusps that is traced by a point on a circle that rolls like 
a gear along the inside of a larger circle. This larger circle is four times the diameter 
of the small circle. The astroid is notable for the diversity of famous mathematicians 
who researched its intriguing properties. The curve was first studied by the Danish 
astronomer Ole Rpmer in 1674, as a result of his quest for gear teeth with more useful 
shapes. Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli (1691), German mathematician 
Gottfried Leibniz (1715), and French mathematician Jean d'Alembert (1748) all 
became fascinated by the curve. 

The astroid has the equation x 2 ^ + y 2 ^ = R 2 ^, where R is the radius of the stationary 
outer circle, and R/4 is the radius of the inner rolling circle. The length of the astroid is 
6R, and the area is 3'rtR 2 /8. Interestingly, its 6R circumference has no dependence on tt, 
despite the involvement of circles that are used for generating the astroid. 

In 1725, mathematician Daniel Bernoulli discovered that an astroid is also traced by 
an inner circle that has % the diameter of the fixed circle. In other words, this traces out 
the same curve as the inner circle with only V4 die diameter of the larger one. 

In physics, the Stoner-Wohlfarth astroid curve is used to characterize various 
properties of energy and magnetism. U.S. Patent 4,987,984 describes the use of an astroid 
for mechanical roller clutches: “The astroid curve provides the same good dispersal of 
stresses that the equivalent circular arc would, but removes less cam race material, giving a 
stronger structure.” 

Interestingly, tangent lines along the astroid curve, when extended until they touch 
the x- and y-axes, all have the same length. You can visualize this by imagining a ladder 
leaning at all possible angles against a wall, which traces out a portion of the astroid curve.

L’Hopital’s Analysis of the 
Infinitely Small 

Guillaume Francois Antoine, Marquis de l’Hopital (1661-1704) 

In 1696, French mathematician Marquis de l’H6pitaI published Europe’s first calculus 
textbook, Analyse des infiniment petits, pour Intelligence des lignes courbes (Analysis 
of the Infinitely Small, for the Understanding of Curves). He intended the book to be 
a vehicle to promote understanding of the techniques of the differential calculus. 
Calculus had been invented a few years earlier by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz 
and refined by the Bernoulli brothers, mathematicians Jacob and Johann. Keith Devlin 
writes, "In feet, until die appearance of THopital's book, Newton, Leibniz, and the two 
Bemoullis were pretty well the only people on the face of the earth who knew much 
about calculus ” 

In the early 1690s, l’Hopital hired Johann Bernoulli to teach him calculus. 
L’Hdpital was so intrigued by calculus that he learned quickly, and soon consolidated 
his knowledge into his comprehensive textbook. Rouse Ball writes of l’H6pital’s book, 
“the credit of putting together the first treatise which explained the principles and use 
of the method is due to l’Hopital... .This work had a wide circulation; it brought the 
differential notation into general use in France, and helped make it known in Europe.” 

Aside from his textbook, l’Hopital is known for the rule of calculus, included in his 
book, for calculating the limiting value of a fraction whose numerator and denominator 
either both approach zero or both approach infinity. He initially had planned a military 
career, but poor eyesight caused him to switch to mathematics. 

Today, we know that I’H6pital, in 1694, paid Bernoulli 300 francs a year to tell him 
of his discoveries, which l’H6pital described in his book. In 1704, after l’Hbpital’s death, 
Bernoulli began to speak of the deal and claimed that many of the results in Analysis 
of the Infinitely Small were due to him.

Rope around the Earth Puzzle 

William Whiston (1667-1752) 

Although this puzzle is not a mathematical milestone on par with most of the otheis in 
this book, this little gem from 1702 is worthy of mention simply because it has intrigued 
schoolchildren and adults for more than two centuries and is a metaphor for how simple 
mathematics may help analysts reason beyond the limits of their own intuition. 

Imagine that you are given a rope that tightly encircles the equator of a basketball. 
How much longer would you have to make the rope so that it is one foot from the 
surface of the basketball at all points? What is your guess? 

Next, imagine that we have the rope around the equator of a sphere the size of the 
Earth, which would make the rope around 25,000 miles long! How much longer would 
you now have to make the rope so that it is one foot off the ground all the way around 
the equator? 

The answer, which is a surprise to most people, is lit or approximately 6.28 feet 
for both the basketball and the Earth—only about the length of an adult man. If R is 
the radius of the Earth, and 1 + R is the radius, in feet, of the enlarged circle, we can 
compare the rope circumference before (IttR) and after 2'ir(l + R), which shows that 
the difference is 2tt feet, independent of the radius of either the Earth or the basketball. 

A puzzle very similar to this appeared in William Whiston’s The Elements of Euclid, 
a book written in 1702 for students. Whiston—an English theologian, historian, and 
mathematician—was probably most famous for his A New Theory of the Earth from its 
Original to the Consummation of All Things (1696), in which he suggests that Noah s 
Flood was caused by a comet

Law of Large Numbers 

Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) 

In 1713, Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli’s proof of his Law of Large Numbers 
(LLN) was presented in a posthumous publication, Ars Conjectandi (The Art of 
Conjecturing). The LLN is a theorem in probability that describes the long-term stability 
of a random variable. For example, when the number of observations of an experiment 
(such as the tossing of a coin) is sufficiently large, then the proportion of an outcome 
(such as the occurrence of heads) will be close to the probability of the outcome, for 
example 0.5. Stated more formally, given a sequence of independent and identically 
distributed random variables with a finite population mean and variance, the average of 
these observations will approach the theoretical population mean. 

Imagine you are tossing a standard six-sided die. We expect the mean of the values 
obtained by tossing to be the average, or 3.5. Imagine that your first three tosses happen to 
be 1,2, and 6, giving a mean of 3. With more tosses, the value of the average eventually 
settles to the expected value of 3.5. Casino operators love the LLN because they can count 
on stable results in the long run and can plan accordingly. Insurers rely on the LLN to 
cope with and plan for variations in losses. 

In Ars Conjectandi , Bernoulli estimates the proportion of white balls in an urn filled 
with an unknown number of black and white balls. By drawing balls from the um and 
"randomly” replacing a ball after each draw, he estimates the proportion of white balls 
by the proportion of balls drawn that are white. By doing this enough times, he obtains 
any desired accuracy for the estimate. Bernoulli writes, "If observations of all events were 
to be continued throughout all eternity (and, hence, the ultimate probability would 
tend toward perfect certainty), everything in the world would be perceived to happen 
in fixed ratios.... Even in the most accidental... occurrences, we would be bound to 
recognize... a certain fate.”

Eulers Number, e 


Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783) 


British science writer David Darling writes that the number e is “possibly the most 
important number in mathematics. Although pi is more familiar to the layperson, e is far 
more significant and ubiquitous in the higher reaches of the subject.” 

The number e, which is approximately equal to 2.71828, can be calculated in many 
ways. For example, it is the limit value of the expression (1 + 1/n) raised to the nth 
power, when n increases indefinitely. Although mathematicians like Jacob Bernoulli and 
Gottfried Leibniz were aware of the constant, Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler was 
among the first to extensively study the number, and he was the first to use the symbol 
e in letters written in 1727. In 1737, he showed that e is irrational—that is, it cannot 
be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In 1748, he calculated 18 of its digits, and today 
more than 100,000,000,000 digits of e are known. 

e is used in diverse areas, such as in the formula for the catenary shape of a 
hanging rope supported at its two ends, in the calculation of compound interest, and 
in numerous applications in probability and statistics. It also appears in one of the most 
amazing mathematical relationships ever discovered, e ,1T + 1 - 0, which unites the 
five most important symbols of mathematics: 1, 0, tt, e, and i (the square root of minus 
one). Harvard mathematician Benjamin Pierce said that “we cannot understand [the 
formula], and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we 
know it must be the truth.” Several surveys among mathematicians have placed this 
formula at the top of the list for the most beautiful formula in mathematics. Kasner and 
Newman note, “We can only reproduce the equation and not stop to inquire into its 
implications. It appeals equally to the mystic, the scientist, and the mathematician.”

formula y = (a/2)-(e*^ a + e -K ^ a ). The Gateway Arch is the world’s tallest monument, with a height of630 feet 
(192 meters). 





















Stirling s Formula 

James Stirling (1692-1770) 


These days, factorials are everywhere in mathematics. For non-negative integers n, 

“n factorial” (written as n!), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 
For example, 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24. The notation n! was introduced by French 
mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. Factorials are important in combinatorics, 
for example, when determining the number of different ways of arranging objects in a 
sequence. They also occur in number theory, probability, and calculus. 

Because factorial values grow so large (for example, 70! is greater than 10 100 , and 
25,206! is greater than lO 100 - 000 ), convenient methods for approximating large factorials 
are extremely useful. Stirling’s formula, nl »* Jilt e -n n n+1/2 , provides an accurate 
estimate for n factorial. Here, the *= symbol means "approximately equal to,” and e and 
tt are the mathematical constants e *= 2.71828 and tt « 3.14159. For large values of n, 
this expression results in an even simpler-looking approximation, ln(n!) « nln(n) - n, 
which can also be written as nl ** n n e~ n . 

In 1730, Scottish mathematician James Stirling presented his approximation for the 
value of n! in his most important work, Methodus Differentialis. Stirling began his career 
in mathematics amidst political and religious conflicts. He was friends with Newton, 
but devoted most of his life after 1735 to industrial management 

Keith Ball writes, “To my mind, this is one of the quintessential discoveries of 
eighteenth-century mathematics. A formula like this gives us some idea of the astonishing 
transformation of mathematics that took place in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. Logarithms were not invented until about 1600. Newton's Principia, setting out 
the principles of calculus, appeared 90 years later. Within another 90 years, mathema¬ 
ticians were producing formulae like Stirlings formula of a subtlety that would have been 
unimaginable without a formalization of the calculus. Mathematics was no longer a game 
for amateurs—it had become a job for professionals.”

Normal Distribution Curve 


Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754), Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), 
Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) 

In 1733, French mathematician Abraham de Moivre was die first to describe the 
normal distribution curve, or law of errors, in Approximatio ad summam terminorum 
binomii (a+b) n in seriem expansi (“Approximation to the Sum of the Terms of a Binomial 
(a+by 1 Expanded as a Series”). Throughout his life, de Moivre remained poor and 
earned money on the side by playing chess in coffeehouses. 

The normal distribution—also called the Gaussian distribution, in honor of Carl 
Friedrich Gauss, who studied the curve years later—represents an important family 
of continuous probability distributions that are applied in countless fields m which 
observations are made. These fields include studies of population demographics, health 
statistics, astronomical measurements, heredity, intelligence, insurance statistics, and 
any fields in which vanation exists in experimental data and observed characteristics. In 
fact, early in the eighteenth century, mathematicians began to realize that a vast number 
of different measurements tended to show a similar form of scattering or distribution. 

The normal distribution is defined by two key parameters, the mean (or average) and 
the standard deviation, which quantifies the spread or variability of the data. The normal 
distribution, when graphed, is often called the bell curve because of its symmetric bell- 
like shape with values more concentrated in the middle than in the tails at the sides of 
the curve. 

De Moivre researched the normal distribution during his studies of approximations 
to the binomial distribution, which arises, for example, in coin toss experiments. Pierre- 
Simon Laplace used the distribution in 1783 to study measurement errors. Gauss applied 
it in 1809 to study astronomical data. 

The anthropologist Sir Francis Galton wrote of the normal distribution, “I know of 
scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order 
expressed by the 'Law of Frequency of Error.’ The law would have been personified by 
the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it It reigns with serenity and in complete 
self-effacement amidst the wildest confusion.”

Euler-Mascheroni Constant 


Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783), Lorenzo Mascheroni (1750-1800) 

The Euler-Mascheroni constant, denoted by the Greek letter y, has a numerical value 
of 0.5772157-... This number links the exponentials and logarithms to number theory, 
and it is defined by the limit of (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 +... + 1/n - log n) as n approaches 
infinity. The reach of y is far and wide, as it plays roles in such diverse areas as infinite 
series, products, probability, and definite integral representations. For example, the 
average number of divisors of all numbers from 1 to n is very close to In n + 2*y - 1. 

Calculating y has not attracted the same public interest as calculating tt, but y has 
still inspired many ardent devotees. While we presently know 7 T to 1,241,100,000,000 
decimal places, in 2008, only about 10,000,000,000 places of y were known. The 
evaluation of "y is considerably more difficult than tt. Here are the first few digits: 0.5772 
1566490153286060651209008240243104215933593992.... 

This mathematical constant has a long and fascinating history, just as do other 
famous constants like tt and e. Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler discussed *y in a 
paper, u De Progressionibus harmonicis observationes ” (“Observations about Harmonic 
Progressions”), published in 1735, but he was only able to calculate it to six decimal 
places at the time. In 1790, Italian mathematician and priest Lorenzo Mascheroni 
computed additional digits. Today, we don’t know if the number can be expressed as a 
fraction (in the way that a number like 0.1428571428571... can be expressed as 1/7). 
Julian Havil, who devoted an entire book to y, tells of stories in which the English 
mathematician G, H. Hardy offered to give up his Savilian Chair at Oxford to anyone 
who proved y could not be expressed as a fraction.

Konigsberg Bridges 

Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783) 


Graph theory is an area of mathematics that concerns how objects are connected and 
often simplifies problems by representing them as dots connected by lines. One of the 
oldest problems in graph theory involves the seven Konigsberg bridges of Germany (now 
part of Russia). People in old Konigsberg loved to take walks along the river, bridges, 
and islands. In the early 1700s, people still wondered if it was possible to take a journey 
across all seven bridges without having to cross any bridge more than once, and return 
to the starting location. Finally, in 1736, Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler proved 
that such a tour was impossible. 

Euler represented the bridges by a graph in which land areas are represented by 
dots and bridges by lines. He showed that one could traverse such a graph by going 
through every segment just once only if the graph had fewer than three vertices of odd 
valence. (The valence of a vertex is the number of lines that start or stop at the vertex.) 
The Konigsberg bridges did not have the proper graph characteristics; thus, it is not 
possible to traverse the graph without going through a line more than once. Euler 
generalized his findings to journeys on any network of bridges. 

The Konigsberg bridge problem is important in the history of mathematics because 
Euler s solution corresponds to the first theorem in graph theory. Today, graph theory 
is used in countless fields, from the study of chemical pathways and car traffic flow to 

the social networks of Internet users. Graph theory can even 
explain how sexually transmitted diseases spread. Euler's very 
simple representations of the bridges’ connectivity, without 
regard to the specifics of bridge lengths, was a forerunner of 
topology, the mathematical field concerned with shapes and 
their relationships to one another.

St. Petersburg Paradox 

Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) 

Daniel Bernoulli, the Dutch-born Swiss mathematician, physicist, and medical 
doctor, wrote a fascinating paper on probability, which was finally published in 1738 
in Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Science of Saint Petersburg. The paper 
described a paradox now known as the St. Petersburg paradox, and it can be expressed 
in terms of coin flips and money that a gambler is to receive, depending on the outcome 
of the flips. Philosophers and mathematicians have long discussed what the fair price 
should be for joining the game. How much would you be ready to pay for joining this 
activity? 

Here's one way to view the St. Petersburg scenario. Flip a penny until it lands tails. 
The total number of flips, n, determines the prize, which equals $2". Thus, if the penny 
lands on tails the first time, the prize is $2* = $2, and the game ends. If the penny 
comes up heads the first time, it is flipped again. If it comes up tails the second time, the 
prize is $2 2 , = $4, and the game ends. And so on. A detailed discussion of the paradox 
of this game is beyond the scope of this book, but, according to game theory, a "rational 
gambler" would enter a game if and only if the price of entry was less than the expected 
value of the financial payoff. In some analyses of the St. Petersburg game, any finite 
price of entry is smaller than the expected value of the game, and a rational gambler 
might desire to play the game no matter how large we set a finite entry price! 

Peter Bernstein comments on the profundity of Bernoulli’s paradox: “His paper is 
one of the most profound documents ever written, not just on the subject of risk but on 
human behavior as well. Bernoulli’s emphasis on the complex relationships between 
measurement and gut touches on almost every aspect of life.”

Since the 1730s, philosophers and mathematicians have pondered the SL Petersburg paradox According to some 
analyses, a player may be expected to win an unlimited amount of money, but how much would you really pay

Goldbach Conjecture 

Christian Goldbach (1690-1764), Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783) 

Sometimes the most challenging problems in mathematics are among the easiest and 
simplest to state. In 1742, Prussian historian and mathematician Christian Goldbach 
conjectured that every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three prime 
numbers, such as 21 = 11 + 7 + 3. (A prime number is a number larger than 1, such 
as 5 or 13, that is divisible only by itself or 1.) As re-expressed by Swiss mathematician 
Leonhard Euler, an equivalent conjecture (called the “strong” Goldbach conjecture) 
asserts that all positive even integers greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of 
two primes. In order to promote the novel JJncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture, 
publishing giant Faber and Faber offered a $1,000,000 prize to anyone who proved 
Goldbach’s conjecture between March 20, 2000, and March 20, 2002, but the prize 
went unclaimed, and the conjecture remains open. In 2008, Tomas Oliveira e Silva, a 
researcher at the University of Aveiro, Portugal, ran a distributed computer search that 
has verified the conjecture up to 12 • 10 17 . 

Of course, no amount of computing power can confirm the conjecture for every 
number; thus, mathematicians hope for an actual proof that Goldbach’s intuition was 
right. In 1966, Chen Jing-Run, a Chinese mathematician, made some progress when he 
proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of one prime, plus a number 
that is the product of at most two primes. So, for example, 18 is equal to 3 + (3 x 5). In 
1995, French mathematician Olivier Ramar6 showed that every even number greater 
than or equal to 4 is the sum of at most six primes.

Agnesi s Instituzioni Analitiche 

Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718-1799) 

Italian mathematician Maria Agnesi is the author of Instituzioni analitiche {Analytical 
Institutions), the first comprehensive textbook that covered both differential and integral 
calculus, and the first surviving mathematical work written by a woman. Dutch mathema¬ 
tician Dirk Jan Struik referred to Agnesi as “the first important woman mathematician 
since Hypatia (A.D. fifth century).” 

Agnesi was a child prodigy, speaking at least seven languages by age 13. For much 
of her life, she avoided social interactions and devoted herself entirely to the study of 
mathematics and religion. Clifford Truesdell writes, “She did ask her father’s permission 
to become a nun. Horrified that his dearest child should desire to leave him, he begged 
her to change her mind.” She agreed to continue living with her father so long as she 
could live in relative seclusion. 

The publication of Instituzioni analitiche caused a sensation in the academic world. 
The committee of the Acad6mie des Sciences in Paris wrote, “It took much skill and 
sagacity to reduce ... to almost uniform methods these discoveries scattered among the 
works of modem mathematicians and often presented by methods very different from 
each other. Order, clarity, and precision reign in all parts of this work—We regard it as 
the most complete and best made treatise.” The book also includes a discussion of the 
cubic curve now known as the Witch of Agnesi and expressed as y = 8tfV(x 2 + 4a 2 ). 

The president of the Academy of Bologna invited Agnesi to accept the Chair of 
Mathematics at the University of Bologna. According to some accounts, she never 
actually went to Bologna because, by this time, she was devoting herself entirely to 
religion and charitable work. Nonetheless, this made her the second woman to be 
appointed professor at a university; the first was Laura Bassi (1711-1778). Agnesi spent 
all her money on helping the poor, and she died in total poverty in a poorhouse.

Euler's Formula for Polyhedra 

Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783), Ren6 Descartes (1596-1650), Paul Erdos 
(1913-1996) 

Euler’s formula for polyhedra is considered to be one of the most beautiful formulas in 
all of mathematics and one of the first great formulas of topology—the study of shapes 
and their interrelationships. A survey conducted of Mathematical Intelligencer readers 
ranked the formula as the second most beautiful formula in history, second to Euler's 
e lTI + 1 = 0, discussed in the entry Euler’s Number, e (1727). 

In 1751, Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler discovered that any 
convex polyhedron (an object with flat faces and straight edges), with V vertices, E 
edges, and F faces, satisfies the equation V - E + F = 2. A polyhedron is convex if it has 
no indentations or holes, or more formally, if every line segment connecting interior 
points is entirely contained within the interior of the figure. 

For example, the surface of a cube has six faces, twelve edges, and eight vertices. 
Plugging these values into Euler’s formula, we obtain 6 - 12 + 8 = 2. For a 
dodecahedron with its 12 faces, we have 20 - 30 + 12 — 2. Interestingly, around 1639, 
Ren£ Descartes discovered a related polyhedral formula that may be converted to 
Euler’s formula through several mathematical steps. 

The polyhedron formula was later generalized to the study of networks and graphs, 
and to help mathematicians understand a wide range of shapes with holes and in 
higher dimensions. The formula also facilitates many practical applications such as 
helping computer specialists find ways to arrange wire paths in electrical circuit and 
cosmologists ponder models for the shape of our universe. 

Euler is second only to Hungarian Paul Erdos as the most prolific mathematician 
in history in terms of number of publications. Sadly, Euler went blind toward the end 
of his life. However, British science writer David Darling notes, “the quantity of his 
output seemed to be inversely proportional to the quality of his sight, because his rate of 
publication increased after he became almost totally blind in 1766.”

Non-convex polyhedra, such as this small stellated dodecahedron by Teja Kraiek, can have Euler characteristics 
other than 2, where the characteristic is equal to V - E + F. Here, F = J2, E = 30, and V = 12, so that the 
characteristic is —6. 















Euler s Polygon Division Problem 

Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783) 

In 1751, Swiss mathematician Leonhard Paul Euler posed the following problem to 
Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach (1690-1764): In how many ways E„ can 
a planar convex polygon of n sides be divided into triangles by diagonals? Or, stated 
more informally: How many ways can you divide a polygonal pie into triangles, starting 
your straight, downward knife cuts at one comer and ending at another? Your cuts can’t 
intersect one another. The formula Euler found was this: 

p _2 -6-10...(4n-10) 

" ("“I)! 

A polygon is convex if, for every pair of points that belong to the shape, the shape 
contains the entire straight line segment connecting the two points. Author and 
mathematician Heinrich Dome writes, “This problem is of the greatest interest because 
it involves many difficulties in spite of its innocuous appearance, as many a surprised 
reader will discover.... Euler himself said, The process of induction I employed was 
quite laborious.’” 

For example, for a square, we have E 4 = 2 , which corresponds to the two diagonals. 
For a pentagon, we have E 5 = 5. In fact, earlier experimenters were inclined to use 
graphic representations to get a feel for the solution, but this visual approach soon 
becomes intractable as the number of polygon sides grows. By the time we get to a 
9-sided polygon, we have 429 ways to divide the polygon into triangles by diagonals. 

The polygon division problem has attracted much attention. In 1758, Carpatho- 
German mathematician Johann Andreas Segner (1704-1777) developed a recurrence 
formula for determining the values: E n = E 2 E n _j + E^E n -2 +... + E n _]E 2 . A recurrence 
formula is one in which each term of the sequence is defined as a function of the 
preceding terms. 

Interestingly, the values of E M are intimately tied to another class of numbers called 
Catalan numbers (E„ = C„_i). Catalan numbers arise in combinatorics, the field of 
mathematics concerned with problems of selection, arrangement, and operation within 
a finite or discrete system.

Knight's Tours 

Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754), Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783), 
Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) 

To create a Knight’s Tour, a chess knight must jump exactly once to every square on the 
8 x8 chessboard in a complete tour. Various kinds of Knight's Tours have fascinated 
mathematicians for centuries. The earliest recorded solution was provided by Abraham 
de Moivre, the French mathematician better known for the normal distribution curve 
and his theorems about complex numbers. In his solution, the knight ends its tour on 
a square that is far away from its starting position. The French mathematician Adrien- 
Marie Legendre “improved” on this and found a solution in which the first and last 
squares are a single move apart so that the tour closes up on itself into a single loop of 
64 knight moves. Such a tour is said to be reentrant. The Swiss mathematician Leonhard 
Euler found a reentrant tour that visits two halves of the board in turn. 

Euler was the first to write a mathematical paper analyzing Knight’s Tours. He 
presented the paper to the Academy of Sciences at Berlin in 1759, but this influential 
paper was not published until 1766. Interestingly, in 1759, the Academy proposed a 
prize of 4,000 francs for the best memoir on the Knight's Tour, but the prize was never 
awarded, perhaps because Euler was the Director of Mathematics at the Berlin Academy 
and ineligible for the prize. 

My favorite Knight's Tour is one over the six surfaces of a cube, each surface being 
a chessboard. Henry E. Dudeney presented the cube tour in his book Amusement in 
Mathematics, and I believe he based the solution (in which each face is toured in turn) 
on the earlier work of French mathematician Alexandre-Th6ophile Vandermonde 
(1735-1796). The properties of Knight’s Tours have since been carefully studied on 
checkerboards on the surfaces of a cylinder, Mobius Strip, torus, and Klein Bottle, and 
even in higher dimensions.

Bayes’ Theorem 

Thomas Bayes (c. 1702-1761) 

Bayes’ theorem, formulated by British mathematician and Presbyterian minister Thomas 
Bayes, plays a fundamental role in science and can be stated by a simple mathematical 
formula used for calculating conditional probabilities. Conditional probability refers to 
the probability of some event A, given the occurrence of some other event B, written as 
P(A|B). Bayes’ theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(BJA) x P(A)]/P(B). Here, P(A) is called the 
prior probability of A because it is the probability of event A without taking into account 
anything we know about B. P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A. P(B) is the 
prior probability of B. 

Imagine we have two boxes. Box 1 has 10 golf balls and 30 billiard balls. Box 2 has 
20 of each. You select a box at random and pull out a ball. We assume that the balls are 
equally likely to be selected. Your ball turns out to be a billiard ball. How probable is it 
that you chose Box 1? In other words, what is the probability that you chose Box I, given 
that you have a billiard ball in your hand? 

Event A corresponds to your picking Box 1. Event B is your picking a billiard 
ball. We want to compute P(A|B). P(A) is 0.5, or 50 percent P(B) is the probability of 
picking a billiard ball regardless of any information on the boxes. It is computed as the 
sum of the probability of getting a billiard ball from a box multiplied by the probability 
of selecting a box. The probability of picking a billiard ball from Box 1 is 0.75. The 
probability of picking one from Box 2 is 0.5. The probability of getting a billiard ball 
overall is 0.75 x 0.5 + 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.625. P(B|A), or the probability of getting a billiard 
ball given that you selected Box 1, is 0.75. We can use Bayes’ formula to find that the 
probability of your having chosen Box 1, which is P(A|B) = 0.6.

Franklin Magic Square 

Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) 

Benjamin Franklin was a scientist, inventor, statesman, printer, philosopher, musician, 
and economist In 1769, in a letter to a colleague, he describes a Magic Square he had 
created earlier in his life. 

His 8x8 magic square is filled with wondrous symmetries, some of which Ben 
Franklin was probably not aware. Each row and column of the square has a sum of 260. 
Half of each row or column sums to half of 260. In addition, each of the bent rows has 
the sum 260. See the gray highlighted squares for two examples of bent rows. See the 
squares with thick black borders for an example of a broken bent row (14 + 61 + 64 + 

15 + 18 + 33 + 36 + 19), which also sums to 260. Numerous other symmetries can 
be found—for example, the four comer numbers and the four middle numbers sum to 
260. The sum of the numbers in any 2x2 subsquare is 130, and the sum of any four 

numbers that are arranged equidistant from 
the center of the square also equals 130. When 
converted to binary numbers, even more startling 
symmetries are found. Alas, despite all the 
marvelous symmetnes, the main diagonals don’t 
each sum to 260, so this cannot strictly qualify 
as a magic square according to the common 
definition that includes the diagonal sums. 

We do not know what method Franklin used 
to construct his squares. Many people have tried 
to crack the secret, but until the 1990s no quick 
recipe could be found, although Franklin claimed he could generate the squares “as 
fast as he could write.” In 1991, author Lalbhai Patel invented a method to construct 
the Franklin squares. Although the method seems quite long, Patel has trained himself 
to quickly carry out the procedure. So many wonderful patterns have been found in 
Franklin’s magic square that this square has become a metaphor for mathematical 
objects that contain symmetries and other properties that continue to be discovered long 
after the inventor’s death.

Minimal Surface 


Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783), Jean Meusnier (1754-1793), Heinrich 
Ferdinand Scherk (1798-1885) 

Imagine withdrawing a flat wire ring from soapy water. Because the ring contains a 
disk-shaped soap film that has less area than other shapes that hypothetically may have 
formed, mathematicians call the surface a minimal surface. More formally, a finite 
minimal surface is often characterized as having the smallest possible area bounded 
by a given closed curve or curves. The mean curvature of the surface is zero. The 
mathematician’s quest for minimal surfaces and proofs of their minimality has lasted for 
more than two centuries. Minimal surfaces with bounding curves that twist into the 
third dimensions can be both beautiful and complicated. 

In 1744, Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler discovered the catenoid, the first 
example of a minimal surface beyond mere trivial examples like circular areas. In 1776, 
French geometer Jean Meusnier discovered the helicoid minimal surface. (Meusnier 
was also a military general and designer of the first propeller-driven, elliptcally shaped 
balloon for carrying people.) 

Another minimal surface wasn’t found until 1873 by German mathematician 
Heinrich Scherk. The same year, the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau performed 
experiments that led him to conjecture that soap films always form minimal surfaces. 
"Plateau’s problem” deals with the mathematics required to prove this to be true. (Plateau 
went blind as a result of staring into the sun for 25 seconds in an experiment dealing with 
vision physiology.) More recent examples include Costa’s minimal surface, which was 
first described mathematically in 1982 by Brazilian mathematician Celso Costa. 

Computers and computer graphics now play a significant role in helping mathe¬ 
maticians construct and visualize minimal surfaces, some of which can be quite 
complicated. Minimal surfaces may one day have numerous applications in materials 
science and nanotechnology. For example, certain polymers, when mixed, form interfeces 
that are minimal surfaces. Knowledge of the interface shapes may help scientists predict 
the chemical properties of such mixtures.

Buffon s Needle 


Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788) 

Named after a district in Monaco famous for its many casinos, Monte Carlo methods 
play critical roles in mathematics and science, and make use of randomness in order to 
solve problems ranging from the statistics of nuclear chain reactions to the regulation 
of traffic flows. 

One of the earliest and most famous uses of the method occurred in the eighteenth 
century when French naturalist and mathematician Comte de Buffon showed that by 
dropping a needle repeatedly onto a lined sheet of paper, and counting the number of 
times the needle touched a line, he could obtain an estimate for the value of the mathe¬ 
matical constant pi (tt = 3.1415...). In the simplest case, imagine dropping a toothpick 
onto a hardwood floor with spacing between the floor lines equal to the toothpick length. 
To approximate pi from the toothpick drops, simply consider the number of drops and 
multiply it by 2, and then divide by the number of times the toothpick touched a line. 

Buffon was a man of many talents. His 36-volume Histoire naturelle, ginirale et 
particuli&re {Natural History: General and Particular) includes everything known about 
the natural world and influenced Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution. 

Today, powerful computers can generate huge quantities of pseudorandom numbers 
per second and allow scientists to take full advantage of Monte Carlo methods in order 
to understand problems in economics, physics, chemistry, protein structure prediction, 
galactic formation, artificial intelligence, cancer therapy, stock forecasting, oil-well 
exploration, the design of aerodynamic shapes, and problems in pure mathematics for 
which no other methods are available. 

In modem times, the Monte Carlo approach was brought to world attention by 
mathematicians and physicists such as Stanislaw Ulam, John von Neumann, Nicholas 
Metropolis, and Enrico Fermi. Fermi used the approach to study properties of the neutron. 
Monte Carlo methods were crucial to the simulations required for the Manhattan Project, 
Americas program to develop an atomic bomb during World War II.

Thirty-Six Officers Problem 

Leonhard Paul Euler (1707-1783), Gaston Tarry (1843-1913) 

Consider six army regiments, each consisting of six officers of different ranks. In 1779, 
Leonhard Euler asked if it was possible to arrange these 36 officers in a 6 x 6 square 
array so that one officer torn each of six regiments appears in each row and one from 
each of six ranks appears in each column. In the language of mathematics, this problem 
is equivalent to finding two mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order six. Euler 
correctly conjectured that there was no solution, and French mathematician Gaston 
Tarry proved this in 1901. Through the centuries, the problem had led to significant 
work in combinatorics, the area of mathematics concerned with the selection and 
arrangement of objects. Latin squares also play a role in error-correcting codes and 
communications. 

A Latin square consists of n sets of numbers, 1 to n, arranged in such a way that 
no row or column contains die same two numbers. The numbers of Latin squares 
starting with order n = 1 are 1, 2, 12, 576, 161,280, 812,851,200, 61,479,419,904,000, 
108,776,032,459,082,956,800, and so forth. 

A pair of Latin squares is said to be orthogonal if the n 2 pairs formed by juxtaposing 
the two arrays are all distinct (Juxtaposing refers to combining the two numbers to form 
an ordered pair.) For example, two orthogonal Latin squares of order 3 are: 



Euler conjectured that if n = 4k + 2, where it is a positive integer, then no pair of 
orthogonal n x n Latin squares exists. This conjecture was not settled for more than a 
century, until 1959, when mathematicians Bose, Shikhande, and Parker constructed a 
pair of 22 x 22 orthogonal Latin squares. Today, we know that a pair of orthogonal n x n 
Latin squares exists for every positive integer n except n = 2 and n = 6.

Sangaku Geometry 

Fujita Kagen (1765-1821) 

A tradition known as Sangaku, or "Japanese temple geometry,” arose during Japan’s 
period of isolation from the West, roughly between 1639 and 1854. Mathematicians, 
farmers, samurai, women, and children solved difficult geometry problems and 
inscribed the solutions on tablets. These colorful tablets were then hung under the 
roofs of the temples. More than 800 tablets have survived, and many of them feature 
problems concerning tangent circles. As one example, consider the figure on the 
opposite page, a late Sangaku tablet from 1873 created by an 11-year-old boy named

In 1789, Japanese mathematician Fujita Kagen published Shimpeki Sampo 
(Mathematical Problems Suspended before the Temple), the first collection of Sangaku 
problems. The oldest surviving tablet dates from 1683, although other historical 
documents refer to examples from as early as 1668. Most of the Sangaku are strangely 
different from typical geometry problems found in textbooks because the Sangaku 
aficionados were usually obsessed with circles and ellipses. Some of the Sangaku 
problems are so difficult that physicist Tony Rothman and educator Hidetoshi Fukagawa 
write, "Modem geometers invariably tackle them with advanced methods, including 
calculus and affine transformations.” However, by avoiding calculus. Sangaku problems 
were, in principle, sufficiently simple that children could solve them with some effort 

Chad Boutin writes, “Perhaps it’s not surprising that Sudoku—the number puzzles 
that everyone seems to be working on these days—first became popular in Japan before 
spreading across the ocean. The fed is reminiscent of a math craze that swept the 
islands centuries ago, when ardent enthusiasts went so far as to turp the most beautiful 
geometrical solutions into finely illustrated wooden tablets, called Sangaku....”

Least Squares 

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) 


You enter a cave with marvelous stalactites protruding from the ceiling. You might 
expect that a correlation exists between the length of a stalactite and its age, although 
the relationship between these two variables may not be exact. Unpredictable tempera¬ 
ture and humidity fluctuations probably affect the growth. However, assuming that 
chemical or physical methods exist for estimating the age of a stalactite, some kind of 
trend surely exists between age and length that lets us make rough predictions. 

The method of least squares has played a crucial role in science for elucidating and 
visualizing trends such as these, and today the method is available in most statistical 
computer packages that draw lines or smooth curves through noisy experimental data. 
Least squares is a mathematical procedure for finding the “best-fitting" curve for a given 
set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets of the points from 
the curve. 

In 1795, German mathematician and scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss, at the age of 
18, began to develop least-squares analysis. He demonstrated the value of his approach 
in 1801, when he predicted the future location of the asteroid Ceres. As background, 
the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi (1746-1826) had originally discovered Ceres 
in 1800, but the asteroid later disappeared behind the sun and could not be relocated. 
Austrian astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach (1754-1832) noted that “without the 
intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss, we might not have found Ceres 
again.” Interestingly, Gauss kept his methods a secret to maintain an advantage over his 
contemporaries and to enhance his reputation. Later in his life, he sometimes published 
scientific results as a cipher, so that he could always prove that he had made various 
discoveries before others had. Gauss finally published his secret least-squares method in 
1809 in his Theory of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies.

Constructing a Regular 
Heptadecagon 

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) 

In 1796, when Gauss was still a teenager, he discovered a way to construct a regular 
17-sided polygon, also known as a heptadecagon, using just a straightedge and compass. 
He published the result in his monumental 1801 work, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae 
(Arithmetic Disquisitions). Gauss’s construction was very significant because only failed 
attempts had been made since the time of Euclid. 

For more than 1,000 years, mathematicians had known how to construct, with a 
compass and straightedge, regular n -gons in which n was a multiple of 3, 5, and powers 
of 2 . Gauss was able to add more polygons to this list, namely those with a prime number 
of sides of the form 2^ + 1, where n is an integer. We can make a list of the first few 
such numbers: Fq = 3, Fj = 5, Fi = 17, Fj = 257, and F 4 = 65,537. (Numbers of this 
form are also known as Fermat numbers, and they are not necessarily prime.) A 257-gon 
was constructed in 1832. 

When he was older, Gauss still regarded his 17-gon finding as one of his greatest 
achievements, and he asked that a regular 17-gon be placed on his tombstone. According 
to legend, the stonemason declined, stating that the difficult construction would 
essentially make the 17-gon look like a circle. 

The year 1796 was an auspicious year for Gauss, when his ideas gushed like a 
fountain from a fire hose. Aside from solving the heptadecagon construction (March 
30), Gauss invented modular arithmetic and presented his quadratic reciprocity law 
(April 8 ) and the prime number theorem (May 31). He proved that every positive integer 
is represented as a sum of at most three triangular numbers (July 10). He also discovered 
solutions of polynomials with coefficients in finite fields (October 1). Regarding the 
heptadecagon. Gauss said he was “amazed” that so little had been discovered with 
respect to polygon construction since Euclid’s time.

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) 

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) is stated in several forms, one of which 
is that every polynomial of degree n ^ 1 , with real or complex coefficients, has n real or 
complex roots. In other words, a polynomial P(x) of degree n has n values (some of 
which are possibly repeated) for which P(x,-) = 0. As background, polynomial equations 
of degree n are of the form P(x) = + u n _ix” -1 + . ..+ a.\X + = 0 where # 0. 

As an example, consider the quadratic polynomial f(x) = x 2 — 4. When plotted, 
the curve is a parabola with its minimum atx = -4. The polynomial has two distinct 
real roots (x = 2 and x = —2), which are graphically seen as points where the parabola 
intersects the x-axis. 

This theorem is notable, in part, because of the sheer number of attempts at proving 
it through history. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss is usually credited 
with the first proof of the FTA, discovered in 1797. In his doctoral thesis, published in 
1799, he presented his first proof, which focused on polynomials with real coefficients, 
and also on his objections to the other previous attempts at proofs. By today's standards, 
Gauss's proof was not rigorously complete, because he relied on the continuity of certain 
curves, but it was a significant improvement over all previous attempts at a proof. 

Gauss considered the FTA to have great importance, as evidenced by his returning 
to the problem repeatedly. His fourth proof was in the last paper he ever wrote, which 
appeared in 1849, exactly 50 years after his dissertation. Note that Jean-Robert Argand 
(1768-1822) published a rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 
in 1806 for polynomials with complex coefficients. The FTA arises in many areas of 
mathematics, and the various proofs span fields that range from abstract algebra and 
complex analysis to topology.

Gauss’s Disquisitiones Arithmeticae 

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) 

Stephen Hawking writes, <f When Gauss began work on his epochal Disquisitiones 
Arithmeticae (Arithmetic Disquisitions), number theory was merely a collection of isolated 

results_In the Disquisitiones, he introduced the notion of congruence and in so doing 

unified number theory.” Gauss published this monumental work at the age of 24. 

The Disquisitiones involves modular arithmetic, which relies on congruency 
relationships. Two integers p and q are "congruent modulo the integer s” if and only if 
(p - q) is evenly divisible by s. Such a congruence is written asp = q (mod s). Using this 
compact notation, Gauss restated and proved the famous quadratic reciprocity theorem, 
which was incompletely proven several years earlier by French mathematician Adrien- 
Marie Legendre (1752—1833). Consider two distinct odd prime numbers, p and q. 
Consider the statements: (1) p is a square mod q, and (2) q is a square mod p. According 
to the theorem: If both p and q are congruent to 3 (mod 4), then exactly one of (1) 
and (2) is true; otherwise, either both (1) and (2) are true, or neither of them is true. (A 
square is an integer that can be written as the square of some other integer, such as 25, 
which is 5 2 .) 

Thus, this theorem connects the solvability of two related quadratic equations in 
modular arithmetic. Gauss devoted an entire section of his book to his proof of this 
theorem. He considered this beloved theorem of quadratic reciprocity to be the “golden 
theorem” or the "gem of arithmetic,” which so enthralled Gauss that he went on to 
provide eight separate proofs over his lifetime. 

Mathematician Leopold Kronecker said, "It is really astonishing to think a single 
man of such young years was [able] to present such a profound and well-organized 
treatment of an entirely new discipline.” In Disquisitiones, Gauss’s approach to providing 
theorems, followed by proofs, corollaries, and examples was used by subsequent authors. 
Disquisitiones was a seed from which flowered the work of many leading nineteenth- 
century number theorists.

Three-Armed Protractor 


Joseph Huddart (1741-1816) 

The common protractor of today is an instrument used to construct and measure angles 
on a plane and to draw lines at various angles. This protractor resembles a semicircular 
disk marked with degrees, from 0° to 180°. In the seventeenth century, protractors began 
to be used as stand-alone instruments rather than as parts of other devices, when sailors 
used them on ocean maps. 

In 1801, Joseph Huddart, an English naval captain, invented the three-armed 
protractor for plotting the position of a boat on navigation maps. This kind of protractor 
makes use of two outer arms that may rotate with respect to a fixed central arm. The two 
rotating arms may be clamped so that they can be set at fixed angles. 

In 1773, Huddart worked for the East India Company, sailing for St. Helena Island 
in the South Atlantic Ocean and Bencooleen in Sumatra. During his journey, he made 
detailed surveys of the west coast of Sumatra. His 1778 chart of St. George’s Channel, 
connecting the Irish Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest, was a 
masterpiece of clarity and accuracy. Aside from his later fame as inventor of the three- 
armed protractor, he also suggested the use of high water marks at the London docks, 
still in use until the 1960s. He invented steam-driven devices for manufacturing rope 
that set the quality standard for rope making. 

In 1916, the United States Hydrographic Office explained the use of his protractor: 
“To plot a position, the two angles observed between the three selected [known] objects 
are set on the instrument, which is then moved over the chart until the three beveled 
edges pass respectively and simultaneously through the three objects. The center of the 
instrument will then mark the ship’s position, which may be pricked on the chart or 
marked with a pencil point through the center hole.”

Fourier Series 


Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) 


Fourier series are useful in countless applications today, ranging from vibration analysis 
to image processing—virtually any field in which a frequency analysis is important. For 
example, Fourier series help scientists characterize and better understand the chemical 
composition of stars or how the vocal tract produces speech. 

Before French mathematician Joseph Fourier discovered his famous series, he 
accompanied Napoleon on his 1789 expedition of Egypt, where Fourier spent several 
years studying Egyptian artifacts. Fourier’s research on the mathematical theory of heat 
began around 1804 when he was back in France, and in 1807 he had completed his 
important memoir On the Propagation of Heat in Solid Bodies. One of his interests 
was heat diffusion in different shapes. For these problems, researchers are usually given 
the temperatures at points on the surface, as well as at its edges, at time t = 0. Fourier 
introduced a series with sine and cosine terms in order to find solutions to these kinds of 
problems. More generally, he found that any differentiable function can be represented 
to arbitrary accuracy by a sum of sine and cosine functions, no matter how bizarre the 
function may look when graphed. 

Biographers Jerome Ravetz and I. Grattan-Guiness note, “Fourier’s achievement 
can be understood by [considering] the powerful mathematical tools he invented for 
the solutions of the equations, which yielded a long series of descendents and raised 
problems in mathematical analysis that motivated much of the leading work in that field 
for the rest of the century and beyond.” British physicist Sir James Jeans (1877-1946) 
remarked, “Fourier’s theorem tells us that every curve, no matter what its nature may be, 
or in what way it was originally obtained, can be exactly reproduced by superposing a 
sufficient number of simple harmonic curves—in brief, every curve can be built up by 
piling up waves.”

Laplace s Theorie Analytique des 
Probabilites 


Pieire-Simon, Marquis de Laplace (1749-1827) 

The first major treatise on probability that combines probability theory and calculus 
was French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace’s Theorie Analytique 
des Probabilites {Analytical Theory of Probabilities). Probability theorists focus on 
random phenomena. Although a single roll of the dice may be considered a random 
event, after numerous repetitions, certain statistical patterns become apparent, and 
these patterns can be studied and used to make predictions. 

The first edition of Laplace s Theorie Analytique was dedicated to Napoleon 
Bonaparte and discusses methods of finding probabilities of compound events from 
component probabilities. The book also discusses the method of least squares and 
Bufifon’s Needle and considers many practical applications. 

Stephen Hawking calls Th&orie Analytique a “masterpiece” and writes, “Laplace 
held that because the world is determined, there can be no probabilities in things. 
Probability results in our lack of knowledge ” According to Laplace, nothing would 
be “uncertain” for a sufficiently advanced being—a conceptual model that remained 
strong until the rise of quantum mechanics and chaos theory in the twentieth century. 

To explain how probabilistic processes can yield predictable results, Laplace asks 
readers to imagine several ums arranged in a circle. One urn contains only black balls, 
while another contains only white balls. The other ums have various ball mixtures. 

If we withdraw a ball, place it in the adjacent um, and continue around the circle, 
eventually the ratio of black to white balls will be approximately the same in all of the 
ums. Here, Laplace shows how random “natural forces” can create results that have 
a predictability and order. Laplace writes, “It is remarkable that this science, which 
originated in the consideration of games of chance, should become the most important 
object of human knowledge... .The most important questions in life are, for the most 
part, really only problems of probability.” Other famous probabilists include Gerolamo 
Cardano (1501-1576), Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), and 
Audrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903-1987).

Prince Rupert s Problem 

Prince Rupert of the Rhine (1619-1682), Pieter Nieuwland (1764-1794) 

Prince Rupert's Problem has had a long and fascinating history. Prince Rupert was 
an inventor, artist, and soldier. He was fluent in virtually all of the major European 
languages and excelled in mathematics. Soldiers were frightened of the large poodle he 
took with him during battles, believing that it had supernatural powers. 

In the 1600s, Prince Rupert asked a famous geometrical question: What is the 
largest wooden cube that can pass through a given cube of side length one inch? More 
precisely, what is the size R of the edge of the largest tunnel (with a square cross section) 
that can be made through a cube without breaking the cube? 

Today, we know the answer to be R = 3>/2 / 4 = 1.060660.... In other words, a 
cube with side length R inches (or smaller) can pass through a cube with a side length 
of 1 inch. Prince Rupert won a wager that a hole could be made in one of two equally 
sized cubes large enough for the other cube to slide through. Many thought this could 
not be accomplished. 

Although the first publication of Prince Ruperts Problem was by John Wallis 
(1616-1703) in his 1685 De Algebra Tractatus, the 1.060660 solution was not readily 
known until Dutch mathematician Pieter Nieuwland solved it over a century after 
Prince Rupert asked the question. His solution was published posthumously in 1816 by 
his teacher Jan Hendrik van Swinden, who had found Nieuwland's solution among 
his papers. 

If you hold a cube so that one comer points toward you, you will see a regular 
hexagon. The largest square that will squeeze through a cube has a face that can be 
inscribed in this hexagon. As reported by mathematicians Richard Guy and Richard 
Nowakowski, the largest cube that can fit through a hypercube has an edge of 
1.007434775..which is the square root of 1.014924..., the smallest root of 
4x 4 - 28x 3 - 7x 2 + 16x + 16.

Bessel Functions 


Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846) 

German mathematician Friedrich Bessel, who had no formal education after the 
age of 14, developed Bessel functions in 1817 for use in his studies of the motion of 
planets moving under mutual gravitation. Bessel had generalized the earlier findings of 
mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782). 

Since the time of Bessel’s discoveries, his functions have become indispensable 
tools in a vast range of mathematics and engineering. Author Boris Korenev writes, 

U A large number of diverse problems concerning practically all the most important 
areas of mathematical physics and vanous technical problems is connected with Bessel 
functions.’’ Indeed, different aspects of Bessel function theory are used when solving 
problems involving heat conduction, hydrodynamics, diffusion, signal processing, 
acoustics, radio and antenna physics, plate vibrations, oscillations in chains, stresses that 
evolve near cracks in materials, wave propagation in general, and atomic and nuclear 
physics. In elasticity theory, Bessel functions are useful for solving numerous spatial 
problems that employ spherical or cylindrical coordinates. 

Bessel functions are solutions to specific differential equations, and when graphed, 
the functions resemble rippling, decaying sinusoidal waves. For example, in the case 
of a wave equation involving a circular membrane such as a drumhead, one class of 
solutions involves Bessel functions, and the standing wave solution can be expressed as 
a Bessel function that Is a function of the distance r from the center to the rim of the 
membrane. 

In 2006, researchers at Japan’s Akishima Laboratories and Osaka University relied 
on Bessel function theory to create a device that uses waves to draw actual text and 
pictures on the surface of water. The device, called AMOEBA (Advanced Multiple 
Organized Experimental Basin), consists of 50 water wave generators encircling a 
cylindrical tank 1.6 meters in diameter and 30 cm deep. AMOEBA is capable of 
spelling out the entire Roman alphabet. Each picture or letter remains on the water 
surface only for a moment, but they can be produced in succession every few seconds.

Babbage Mechanical Computer 

Charles Babbage (1792-1871), Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace 
(1815-1852) 

Charles Babbage was an English analyst, statistician, and inventor who was also 
interested in the topic of religious miracles. He once wrote, “Miracles are not a breach 
of established laws, but... indicate the existence of far higher laws ” Babbage argued 
that miracles could occur in a mechanistic world. Just as Babbage could imagine 
programming strange behaviors on his calculating machines, God could program 
similar irregularities in nature. While investigating biblical miracles, he suggested that 
the chance of a man rising from the dead is one in 10 12 . 

Babbage is often considered the most important mathematician-engineer involved 
in the prehistory of computers. In particular, he is famous for conceiving an enormous 
hand-cranked mechanical calculator, an early progenitor of our modem computers. 
Babbage thought the device would be most useful in producing mathematical tables, 
but he worried about mistakes that would be made by humans who transcribed the 
results from its 31 metal output wheels. Today, we realize that Babbage was around 
a century ahead of his time and that the politics and technology of his era were 
inadequate for his lofty dreams. 

Babbage’s Difference Engine, begun in 1822 but never completed, was designed 
to compute values of polynomial functions, using about 25,000 mechanical parts. He 
also had plans to create a more general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, 
which could be programmed using punch cards and had separate areas for number 
storage and computation. Estimates suggest that an Analytical Engine capable of storing 
1,000 50-digit numbers would be more than 100 feet (about 30 meters) in length. 

Ada Lovelace, the daughter of the English poet Lord Byron, gave specifications for a 
program for the Analytical Engine. Although Babbage provided assistance to Ada, many 
consider Ada to be the first computer programmer. 

In 1990, novelists William Gibson and Bruce Sterling wrote The Difference Engine, 
which asked readers to imagine the consequences of Babbage s mechanical computers 
becoming available to Victorian society.

Cauchy’s he Calcul Infinitesimal 

Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) 

American mathematician William Waterhouse writes, “Calculus in 1800 was in a 
curious state. There was no doubt it was correct. Mathematicians of sufficient skill 
and insight had been successful with it for a century. Yet no one could explain clearly 
why it worked.... Then came Cauchy.” In his 1823 R6sum6 des legons sur le calcul 
infinitesimal (Resume of Lessons on Infinitesimal Calculus), the prolific French 
mathematician Augustin Cauchy provides a rigorous development of calculus and a 
modem proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which elegantly unites the two 
major branches of calculus (differential and integral) into a single framework. 

Cauchy begins his treatise with a clear definition of the derivative. His mentor, 
French mathematician foseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813), thought in terms of graphs 
of curves and considered the derivative a tangent to a curve. In order to determine 
a derivative, Lagrange would search for derivative formulas as necessary. Stephen 
Hawking writes, “Cauchy went far beyond Lagrange and defined the derivative of f at x 
as the limit of the difference quotient Ay/Ax = [fix + i ) - f(x)]/i n as i approaches zero, 
which is our modem, nongeometric definition of the derivative. 

Similarly, by clarifying the notion of the integral in calculus, Cauchy demonstrated 
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which establishes a way in which we can 
compute the integral of f(x) from x = a to x = b for any continuous function f More 
particularly, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if f is an integrable 
function in the interval [a, b\, and if H(x) is the integral of f(x) from a to x < b, then the 
derivative of H(x) is identical to f(x). In other words, H'(x) = fix). 

Waterhouse concludes, “Cauchy did not really establish new foundations; he swept 
away all the dust to reveal the whole edifice of calculus already standing on bedrock....”

Barycentric Calculus 

August Ferdinand Mobius (1790-1868) 

German mathematician August Ferdinand Mobius, famous for his one-sided loop called 
the Mobius strip, also made a major contribution to mathematics with his barycentric 
calculus, a geometrical method for defining a point as the center of gravity of certain 
other points to which coefficients or weights are ascribed. We can think of Mobius’s 
barycentric coordinates (or barycentrics) as coordinates with respect to a reference triangle. 
These coordinates are usually written as triples of numbers, which can be visualized as 
corresponding to masses placed at the vertices of the triangle. In this way, these masses 
determine a point, which is the geometric centroid of the three masses. The new algebraic 
tools, developed by Mobius in his 1827 book Der Barycentrische Calcul ('The Barycentric 
Calculus), have since turned out to have wide application. This classic book also discusses 
related topics in analytical geometry such as projective transformations. 

The word barycentric is derived from the Greek barys for “heavy” and refers to 
the center of mass. Mobius understood that several weights positioned along a straight 
stick can be replaced by a single weight at the stick’s center of mass. From this simple 
principle, he constructed a mathematics system in which numerical coefficients are 
assigned to every point in space. 

Today, barycentric coordinates are treated as a form of general coordinates that 
are used in many branches of mathematics and in computer graphics. Many of the 
advantages of barycentric coordinates occur in the field of Projective Geometry, which 
is concerned with incidences— that is, where elements such as lines, planes, and points 
either coincide or do not. Projective geometry is also concerned with the relationships 
between objects and the mappings that result from projecting the objects onto another 
surface, which can be visualized as shadows of solid objects.

Non-Euclidean Geometry 

Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky (1792-1856), Janos Bolyai (1802-1860), 

Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) 

Since the time of Euclid (c. 325-270 B.C.), the so-called parallel postulate seemed to 
reasonably describe how our three-dimensional world works. According to this postulate, 
given a straight line and a point not on that line, only one straight line through the point 
exists that never intersects the original line. 

Over time, the formulations of non-Euclidean geometry, in which this postulate 
does not hold, have had dramatic consequences. Einstein said about non-Euclidean 
geometry: “To this interpretation of geometry, I attach great importance, for should I 
have not been acquainted with it, I never would have been able to develop the theory 
of relativity.” In fact, Einstein's General Theory of Relativity represents space-time as a 
non-Euclidean geometry in which space-time actually warps, or curves, near gravitating 
bodies such as the sun and planets. This can be visualized by imagining a bowling ball 
sinking into a rubber sheet. If you were to place a marble into the depression formed 
by the stretched rubber sheet, and give the marble a sideways push, it would orbit the 
bowling ball for a while, like a planet orbiting the sun. 

In 1829, Russian mathematician Nicolai Lobachevsky published On the Principles 
of Geometry, in which he imagined a perfectly consistent geometry that results from 
assuming that the parallel postulate is false. Several years earlier, Hungarian mathemati¬ 
cian J^nos Bolyai had worked on a similar non-Euclidean geometry, but his publication 
was delayed until 1932. In 1854, German mathematician Bernhard Riemann generalized 
the findings of Bolyai and Lobachevsky by showing that various non-Euclidean 
geometries are possible, given the appropriative number of dimensions. Riemann once 
remarked, “The value of non-Euclidean geometry lies in its ability to liberate us from 
preconceived ideas in preparation for the time when exploration of physical laws might 
demand some geometry other than die Euclidean.” His prediction was realized later 
with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.

One form of non-Euclidean geometry is exemplified by Jos Leys’s hyperbolic tiling Artist M. C. Escher also 
experimented with non-Euclidean geometries in which the entire universe could be compressed and represented in 
a finite disk. 






Mobius Function 


August Ferdinand Mobius (1790-1868) 

In 1831, August Mobius introduced his exotic Mobius function, today written as |x(n). 
To understand the function, imagine placing all the integers into just one of three large 
mailboxes. The first mailbox is painted with a big “0,” the second with "+1 ” and a third 
with 1." In mailbox 0, Mobius places multiples of square numbers (other than 1), 

including {4, 8,9,12,16, 18,...A square number is a number such as 4,9, or 16 that 
is the square of another integer. For example, jx(12) = 0, because 12 is a multiple of die 
square number 4 and is thus placed in mailbox “0.” 

In the -1 mailbox, Mobius places any number that factors into an odd number of 
distinct prime numbers. For example, 5 x 2 x 3 = 30, so 30 is in this list because it has 
these three prime factors. All prime numbers are also on this list because they only have 
one prime factor, themselves. Thus, |x(29) = -1 and |x(30) = -1. The probability that a 
number fells in the -1 mailbox turns out to be 3 /tt 2 —the same probability as for felling 
in the +1 mailbox. 

Let's further consider die +1 mailbox, in which Mobius places all die numbers, 
such as 6, that factor into an even number of distinct primes (2 x 3 = 6). For complete¬ 
ness, Mobius put 1 into this bin. Numbers in this mailbox include {1,6,10,14, 15, 

21, 22,...}. The first 20 terms of the wonderful Mobius function are |x(n) = (I, -1, — 1, 
0, -1,1, -1, 0,0,1, -1,0, -1,1,1, 0, -1, 0, -1,0}. 

Amazingly, scientists have found practical uses of the Mobius function in various 
physical interpretations of subatomic particle theory. The Mobius function is also 
fascinating because almost everything about its behavior is unsolved and because 
numerous elegant mathematical identities exist that involve |x(n).

Group Theory 

Evariste Galois (1811-1832) 

French mathematician fivariste Galois was responsible for Galois theory, an important 
branch of abstract algebra, and famous for his contributions to group theory, which 
concerns the mathematical study of symmetry. In particular, in 1832, he produced a 
method of determining when a general equation could be solved by radicals, thereby, in 
essence, giving a kick start to modem group theory. 

Martin Gardner writes, "In 1832.. .he was killed by a pistol shot... He was not yet 
21. Some early, fragmentary work had been done on groups, but it was Galois who laid 
the foundations of modem group theory and even named it, all in a long, sad letter 
that he wrote to a friend the night before his fetal duel.” One key aspect of a group is 
that it is a set of elements with an operation that combines any two of its elements to 
form a third element within that set. For example, consider the set of integers and the 
operation of addition, which together form a group. Adding two integers always yields 
an integer. A geometrical object can be characterized by a group called a symmetry 
group that specifies the symmetry features of the object. This group contains a set of 
transformations that leave the object unchanged when applied. Today, important topics 
in group theory are often illustrated to students using the Rubik's Cube. 

The circumstances that led to Galois’ death have never been fully explained. 
Perhaps his death resulted from a quarrel over a woman or for political reasons. In any 
case, preparing for the end, he spent the night feverishly outlining his mathematical 
ideas and discoveries. The figure at right shows a page from his last night’s writing on 
quintic equations (equations with the term x 5 ). 

The next day, Galois was hit in the stomach. He lay helpless on the ground. There 
was no physician to help him, and the victor casually walked away, leaving Galois to 
writhe in agony. His mathematical reputation and legacy rests on fewer than 100 pages 
of a posthumously published work of genius.

Pigeonhole Principle 

Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859) 

The first statement of the Pigeonhole Principle was made by German mathematician 
Johann Dirichlet in 1834, although he referred to it as Schvbfachprinzip ("Drawer 
Principle”). The phrase “Pigeonhole Principle” was first used in a serious mathematics 
journal by mathematician Raphael M. Robinson in 1940. Simply stated, if we have m 
pigeon homes and n pigeons, we can be sure that at least one home houses more than 
one pigeon if n > m. 

This simple assertion has been used in applications that range from computer data 
compression to problems that involve infinite sets that cannot be put into one-to-one 
correspondence. The Pigeonhole Principle has also been generalized to probabilistic 
applications so that if n pigeons are randomly placed in m pigeonholes with uniform 
probability of 1/m, then at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon 
with probability 1 - m!/[(m - n)!m”]. Let us consider some examples that may 
demonstrate unintuitive results. 

Because of the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two people in New 
York City with the same number of hairs on their heads. Let the hairs be represented as 
pigeonholes and the people as pigeons. New York City has more than 8 million people, 
and the human head has far Jess than a million hairs; thus, at least two people must exist 
with the same number of hairs on their heads. 

A paper with the dimensions of a dollar bill is colored blue and red on one surface. 
Is it always possible to find two points of the same color exactly one inch apart on such 
a surface, no matter how intricately the surface is colored? To solve, draw an equilateral 
triangle with one-inch edges. Consider the colors as pigeonholes and the triangle 
vertices as pigeons. At least two of its vertices must be of the same color. This proves that 
two points of the same color must exist exactly one inch apart

Quaternions 

Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) 


Quaternions are four-dimensional numbers, conceived m 1843 by Irish mathematician 
William Hamilton. Quaternions have since been used to describe the dynamics of 
motion in three dimensions and applied in such fields as computer graphics for virtual 
realities, video game programming, signal processing, robotics, bioinformatics, and 
studies of the geometry of space-time. The flight software of the Space Shuttle makes 
use of quaternions for guidance computations, navigation, and flight control, for reasons 
of speed, compactness, and reliability. 

Despite the potential usefulness of quaternions, some mathematicians were 
skeptical at first Scottish physicist William Thomson (1824-1907) wrote, “Quaternions 
came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done, and though beautifully 
ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way.” 

On the other hand, engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside wrote m 1892, “The 
invention of quaternions must be regarded as a most remarkable feat of human ingenuity. 
Vector analysis, without quaternions, could have been found by any mathematician... 
but to find out quaternions required genius.” Interestingly, Theodore Kaczynski (the 
“Unabomber”) wrote intricate mathematical treatises on quaternions before he went on 
his killing spree. 

Quaternions can be represented in four dimensions by Q = Uq + dji + a^j + a^k 
where i, j, and k are (like the imaginary number i) unit vectors in three orthogonal 
(perpendicular) directions, and they are perpendicular to the real number axis. To add 
or multiply two quaternions, we treat them as polynomials in i, /, and k, but use the 
following rules to deal with products: i 2 = / 2 = fe 2 = -1; ij = -ji = k; jk = -kj = i; and 
ki = -ik = j. Hamilton tells us that he cut these formulas into a stone of Brougham 
Bridge in Dublin while walking with his wife, after the ideas came to him in a flash.

Transcendental Numbers 


Joseph Liouville (1809-1882), Charles Hermite (1822-1901), Ferdinand von 
Lindemann (1852-1939) 

In 1844, French mathematician Joseph Liouville considered the following interesting 
number: 0.110001000000000000000001000..., known today as the Liouville constant. 
Can you guess its significance or what rule he used to create it? 

Liouville showed that his unusual number was transcendental, thus making this 
number among the first to be proven transcendental. Notice that the constant has 1 in 
each decimal place corresponding to a factorial, and zeros elsewhere. This means that 
the Is occur only in the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 24th, 120th, 720th, etc. places. 

Transcendental numbers are so exotic that they were only “discovered” relatively 
recently in history, and you may only be familiar with one of them, tt, and perhaps 
Euler’s Number, e. These numbers cannot be expressed as the root of any algebraic 
equation with rational coefficients. This means, for example, that tt could not exactly 
satisfy equations like 2x 4 - 3x? + 7 = 0. 

Proving that a number is transcendental is difficult. French mathematician Charles 
Hermite proved e was transcendental in 1873, and German mathematician Ferdinand 
von Lindemann proved tt was transcendental in 1882. In 1874, German mathematician 
Georg Cantor surprised many mathematicians by demonstrating that “almost all” real 
numbers are transcendental. Thus, if you could somehow put all the numbers in a big 
jar, shake the jar, and pull one out, it would be virtually certain to be transcendental. Yet 
despite the fact that transcendental numbers are “everywhere,” only a few are known and 
named. There are lots of stars in the sky, but how many can you name? 

Aside from his mathematical pursuits, Liouville was interested in politics and was 
elected to the French Constituting Assembly in 1848. After a later election defeat, 
Liouville became depressed. His mathematical ramblings became interspersed with 
poetical quotes. Nonetheless, during the course of his life, Liouville wrote more than 
400 serious mathematical papers.

Catalan Conjecture 

Eugene Charles Catalan (1814-1894), Freda Mihailescu (b. 1955) 

Deceptively simple-looking challenges involving whole numbers can confound even 
the most brilliant mathematicians. As in the case of Fermat’s Last Theorem, centuries 
may pass before simple conjectures concerning integers are proved or refuted. Some 
problems may never be solved, even with the combined efforts of humans and 
computers. 

To set the stage for understanding the Catalan conjecture, consider die squares of 
whole numbers (integers) greater than 1, that is, 4,9,16, 25,... and also consider the 
sequence of cubes, 8, 27, 64, 12 5.... If we merge the two lists and place them in order, 
we obtain 4,8,9,1 6 , 25, 27, 3 6 ,.... Notice that 8 (the cube of 2) and 9 (the square of 3) 
are consecutive integers. In 1844, Belgian mathematician Eugbne Catalan conjectured 
that 8 and 9 are the only powers of integers that are consecutive! If other such pairs 
had existed, they might have been found by searching for integer values for which 
xP - y<? = 1 is true and for values of x, y, p, and q greater than 1. Catalan believed that 
only one solution exists: 3 2 — 2^ = 1. 

This history of the Catalan conjecture has a colorful cast of characters. Hundreds 
of years before Catalan, Frenchman Levi ben Gerson (1288-1344)—better known as 
Gersonides or the Ralbag—had already demonstrated a more restricted version of the 
conjecture, namely that the only powers of 2 and 3 that differ by 1 are 3 2 and 2 3 . The 
Ralbag was a famous rabbi, philosopher, mathematician, and Talmudist 

Let’s skip forward to 1976 when Robert Tijdeman of the University of Leiden in 
the Netherlands showed that if examples of other consecutive powers existed, then they 
would have to be finite in number. Finally, in 2002, Preda Mihailescu of the University 
of Paderbom in Germany proved Catalan's conjecture.

The Matrices of Sylvester 

James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897), Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) 

In 1850, in his paper “On a New Class of Theorems,” British mathematician James 
Sylvester was the first to use the word matrix when referring to a rectangular arrange¬ 
ment, or array, of elements that can be added and multiplied. Matrices are often used to 
describe a system of linear equations or simply to represent information that depends 
on two or more parameters. 

Credit for understating and identifying the complete significance of the algebraic 
properties of matrices is given to the English mathematician Arthur Cayley for his later 
work on matrices in 1855. Because Cayley and Sylvester enjoyed many years of close 
collaboration, they are often considered the joint founders of matrix theory. 

Although matrix theory flourished in the mid-1800s, simple concepts of matrices 
date back to before the birth of Christ, when the Chinese knew of Magic Squares 
and also began to apply matrix methods to solve simultaneous equations. In the 1600s, 
Japanese mathematician Seki Kowa (in 1683) and German mathematician Gottfried 
Leibniz (in 1693) also explored the early use of matrices. 

Both Sylvester and Cayley studied at Cambridge, but Sylvester was ineligible 
for a degree because he was Jew, although he was ranked second in Cambridge’s 
mathematical examinations. Before Cambridge, Sylvester had attended the Royal 
Institution in Liverpool, where students tormented him for his religion, thus causing 
him to escape to Dublin. 

Cayley worked as a lawyer for more than a decade, while publishing about 250 
mathematics papers. During his time at Cambridge, he published another 650 papers. 
Cayley was first to introduce matrix multiplication. 

Today, matrices are used in numerous areas, including data encryption and decryp¬ 
tion, object manipulation in computer graphics (including video games and medical 
imaging), solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, quantum mechanical studies 
of atomic structure, equilibrium of rigid bodies in physics, graph theory, game theory, 
economics models, and electrical networks.

Four-Color Theorem 


Francis Guthrie (1831-1899), Kenneth Appel (b. 1932), 

Wolfgang Haken (b. 1928) 

Mapmakers have believed for centuries that just four colors were sufficient for coloring 
any map drawn on a plane, so that no two distinct regions sharing a common edge are 
the same color, although two regions can share a common vertex and have the same 
color. Today, we know for certain that while some planar maps require fewer colors, 
no map requires more than four. Four colors are sufficient for maps drawn on spheres 
and cylinders. Seven colors are sufficient to paint any map on a torus (the surface of a 
doughnut shape). 

In 1852, mathematician and botanist Francis Guthrie was the first to conjecture 
that four colors must be sufficient when he attempted to color a map of counties of 
England. Since the time of Guthne, mathematicians had tried in vain to prove the 
consequences of this seemingly simple four-color observation, and it remained one of 
the most famous unsolved problems in topology. 

Finally, in 1976, mathematicians Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken succeeded 
in proving the four-color theorem with the help of a computer testing thousands of 
cases, making it the first problem in pure mathematics to make use of a computer to 
produce an essential component for the proof. Today, computers are playing increasing 
roles in mathematics, helping mathematicians verify proofs so complex that they 
sometimes defy human comprehension. The four-color theorem is one example. 
Another is the classification of finite simple groups, embodied in a 10,000-page multi¬ 
author project. Alas, the traditional people-centered methods for ensuring that a proof is 
correct breaks down when a paper reaches thousands of pages. 

Surprisingly, the four-color theorem has been of little practical importance for 
mapmakers and cartographers. For example, a study of aliases through time reveals no 
pressing desire to try to minimize the number of colors used, and books on cartography 
and mapmaking history often use more colors than needed.

Boolean Algebra 

George Boole (1815-1864) 

English mathematician George Boole’s most important work was his 1854 An 
Investigation into the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical 
Theories of Logic and Probabilities. Boole was interested in reducing logic to a simple 
algebra involving just two quantities, 0 and 1, and three basic operations: and, or, and 
not In modem times. Boolean algebra has had vast applications in telephone switching 
and the design of modern computers. Boole looked upon this work as “the most 
valuable.. .contribution that I have made or am likely to make to Science and the 
thing by which I would desire if at all to be remembered hereafter....” 

Alas, Boole died at the age of 49 after he developed a bad fever. Unfortunately, his 
wife believed that a remedy should resemble the cause, and she dumped buckets of 
water over him while he was in his bed, because his illness had been precipitated by 
being out in the cold rain. 

Mathematician Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) praised his work, saying “Boole’s 
system of logic is but one of many proofs of genius and patience combined.... That 
the symbolic processes of algebra, invented as tools of numerical calculation, should be 
competent to express every act of thought, and to furnish the grammar and dictionary of 
an all-containing system of logic, would not have been believed until it was proved.. 

Approximately seventy years after Boole’s death, American mathematician Claude 
Shannon (1916-2001) was introduced to Boolean algebra while still a student, and 
he showed how Boolean algebra could be used to optimize the design of systems of 
telephone routing switches. He also demonstrated that circuits with relays could solve 
Boolean algebra problems. Thus, Boole, with Shannon’s help, provided one of the 
foundations for our Digital Age.

Icosian Game 


Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) 

In 1857, Irish mathematician, physicist, and astronomer William Hamilton described 
the Icosian Game, the objective of which is to find a path along the edges of a 
dodecahedron (a polyhedron with 12 faces) so that every vertex (comer) is visited only 
once. Today, in the field of graph theory, mathematicians refer to a Hamiltonian path 
as one in which a path visits each graph vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or 
Hamiltonian circuit)—required for the Icosian Game—implies that the path returns 
to the starting point British mathematician Thomas Kirkman (1806-1895) posed the 
Icosian Game problem more generally: Given a graph of a polyhedron, does a cycle 
exist that passes through every vertex? 

The term Icosian comes from Hamilton's invention of a kind of algebra called Icosian 
calculus , based on the symmetry properties of the icosahedron. He solved his puzzle 
using this algebra and its associated icosians (special kinds of vectors). All Platonic solids 
are Hamiltonian. In 1974, mathematician Frank Rubin described an efficient search 
procedure that can find some or all Hamilton paths and circuits in graphs. 

A London toy manufacturer bought the rights to the Icosian Game and created a 
puzzle that had nails at each vertex of the dodecahedron. Each nail stood for a major 
city. The player traced out his path by wrapping a string around each nail as he traveled. 
The toy was also sold in other forms—for example, as a flat pegboard with holes at 
the nodes of the dodecahedron. (A flat model of a dodecahedron can be created by 
puncturing one of its feces and stretching the object flat so that it lies on a plane.) Alas, 
the game did not sell well, partly because it was fairly easy to solve. Perhaps Hamilton’s 
focus on deep theories made him overlook the feet that trial and error would soon lead 
to a solution)

Harmonograph 

Jules Antoine Lissajous (1822-1880), Hugh Blackburn (1823-1909) 

The harmonograph is a Victorian art device that usually employs just two pendulums to 
trace out paths that can be studied from both an artistic and mathematical perspective. 

In one version, a pendulum moves a pen. The other pendulum moves a table with a 
sheet of paper. The combined effect of the two pendulums produces a complicated 
motion that steadily decays to a single point due to friction. Each path of the pen, upon 
each revolution, is a short distance away from the path on the previous revolution, giving 
the patterns a wavy, spider-web-like appearance. By varying the frequency and phases of 
the pendulums relative to one another, a wide range of patterns is generated. 

In the simplest version, the patterns may be characterized as Lissajous curves that 
describe complex harmonic motion and can be represented (assummg no friction) by the 
curves produced by x(t) - Asin(df + d), y(t) = Bsin(bt), where t is time, and A and B are 
amplitudes. The ratio of a to b controls the relative frequencies, and d is a phase difference. 
From relatively few parameters, a huge panoply of ornamental curves is produced. 

The first harmonographs were constructed in 1857, when French mathematician 
and physicist Jules Antoine Lissajous demonstrated patterns produced by two tuning 
forks, attached to small mirrors that vibrated at different frequencies. A beam of light 
reflected off the mirrors to produce the intricate curves that delighted a general public. 

British mathematician and physicist Hugh Blackburn is credited with making the 
first more traditional pendulum versions of the harmonograph, and many variations of 
Blackburn’s harmonograph have been created up to the present day. More complex 
harmonographs may employ additional pendulums that hang off one another. In my 
novel The Heaven Virus , we encounter a zany alien harmonograph with “a pen that 
oscillates on a platform that oscillated on another platform, which oscillated on another 
platform, and so on for ten different platforms.”

The Mobius Strip 

August Ferdinand Mobius (1790-1868) 


German mathematician August Ferdinand Mobius was a shy, unsociable, absentminded 
professor whose most famous discovery, the Mobius strip, was made when he was almost 
seventy years old. To create the strip yourself, simply join the two ends of a ribbon after 
giving one end a 180-degree twist with respect to the other end. The result is a one-sided 
surface—a bug can crawl from any point on such a surface to any other point without 
ever crossing an edge. Try coloring a Mobius strip with a crayon. It’s impossible to color 
one side red and the other green because the strip has only one side. 

Years after Mobius’s death, the popularity and applications of the strip grew, and it 
has become an integral part of mathematics, magic, science, art, engineering, literature, 
and music. The Mobius strip is the ubiquitous symbol for recycling where it represents 
the process of transforming waste materials into useful resources. Today, the Mobius 
strip is everywhere, from molecules and metal sculptures to postage stamps, literature, 
technology patents, architectural structures, and models of our entire universe. 

August Mobius had simultaneously discovered his famous strip with a contemporary 
scholar, the German mathematician Johann Benedict Listing (1808-1882). However, 
Mobius seems to have taken the concept a little further than Listing, as Mobius more 
closely explored some of the remarkable properties of this strip. 

The Mobius strip is the first one-sided surface discovered and investigated by 
humans. It seems far-fetched that no one had described the properties of one-sided 
surfaces until the mid-1800s, but history has recorded no such observations. Given that 
the Mobius strip is often the first and only exposure of a wide audience to the study of

Holditch’s Theorem 


Hamnet Holditch (1800-1867) 

Draw a smooth, closed, convex curve Cj. Place a chord of constant length inside curve 
Cj, and let the chord slide around inside the curve so that the two ends of die chord 
touch Ci at all times. (You can visualize this as moving a stick around on the surface of 
a puddle that has die shape of curve Ci.) Label a point on the stick so that it divides the 
stick into two parts of length p and q. As you move the stick, the point traces out a new 
closed curve C 2 within die original curve. Assuming that Cj is shaped in such a way 
that the stick can actually pass around Ci once, Holditch’s theorem states that the area 
between the curves Cj and C 2 will be 'npq. Interestingly, this area is totally independent 
of the shape of Cj. 

Mathematicians have marveled at Holditch’s theorem for more than a century. For 
example, in 1988, British mathematician Mark Cooker wrote, “Two things immediately 
struck me as astonishing. First, the formula for the area is independent of the size of the 
given curve Cj. Second, [die equation for the area] is the area of an ellipse of semi-axes 
p and q, but there are no ellipses in the theorem!” 

The theorem was published by Rev. Hamnet Holditch in 1858. Holditch was 
president of Caius College in Cambridge during the middle part of the 1800s. The 
Hol ditch curv e C 2 for a circle C] of radius R is another circle, which has radius 
r = Jr? — pq _

Riemann Hypothesis 

Georg Freidrich Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) 

Many mathematical surveys indicate that the “proof of the Riemann hypothesis” is the 
most important open question in mathematics. The proof involves the zeta. function, 
which can be represented by a complicated-looking curve that is useful in number 
theory for investigating properties of prime numbers. Written as £(x), the function 
was originally defined as the infinite sum £(x) = 1 + (1/2)* + (1/3)* + (1/4)* + ...etc. 
When x = 1, this series has no finite sum. For values ofx larger than 1, the series adds 
up to a finite number. If x is less than 1, the sum is again infinite. The complete zeta 
function, studied and discussed in the literature, is a more complicated function that is 
equivalent to this series for values of x greater than 1, but has finite values for any real or 
complex number, except for when the real part is equal to 1. We know that the function 
equals zero when x is -2, -4, —6,... and that the function has an infinite number 
of zero values for the set of complex numbers, the real part of which is between zero 
and one—but we do not know exactly for what complex numbers these zeros occur. 
Mathematician Georg Bernhard Riemann conjectured that these zeros occur for those 
complex numbers the real part of which equals 1/2. Although vast numerical evidence 
exists that favors this conjecture, it is still unproven. The proof of Riemann s hypothesis 
would have profound consequences for the theory of prime numbers and in our 
understanding of the properties of complex numbers. Amazingly, physicists may have 
found a mysterious connection between quantum physics and number theory through 
investigations of the Riemann Hypothesis. 

Today, more than 11,000 volunteers around the world are working on the Riemann 
hypothesis, using a distributed computer software package at Z etagrid.net to search for 
the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. More than 1 billion zeros for the zeta function 
are calculated every day.

Beltrami’s Pseudosphere 

Eugenio Beltrami (1835-1899) 

The pseudosphere is a geometrical object that resembles two musical horns glued 
together at their rims. The "mouthpieces” of the two horns are located at the ends of 
two infinitely long tails, as if to be blown only by the omnipotent gods. The peculiar 
shape was first discussed in depth in the 1868 paper “Essay on an Interpretation of Non- 
Euclidean Geometry” by Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami, famous for his work 
in geometry and physics. To produce the surface, a curve called a tractrix is rotated 
about its asymptote. 

Whereas an ordinary sphere has a property called positive curvature everywhere 
on its surface, a pseudosphere has a constant negative curvature, which means that it 
can be thought of as maintaining a constant concavity over its entire surface (except 
at its central cusp). Thus, a sphere is a closed surface with a finite area, while a 
pseudosphere is an open surface with infinite area. British science writer David Darling 
writes, "In feet, although both the two-dimensional plane and a pseudosphere are 
infinite, the pseudosphere manages to have more room! One way to think of this is 
that a pseudosphere is more intensely infinite than the plane ” The negative curvature 
of a pseudosphere requires that the angles of a triangle drawn on its surface add up 
to less than 180°. The geometry of the pseudosphere is called hyperbolic, and some 
astronomers in the past have suggested that our entire universe might be described 
by hyperbolic geometry with properties of a pseudosphere. The pseudosphere is of 
historical importance because it was one of the first models for a Non-Euclideau space. 

Beltrami's interests ranged far beyond mathematics. His four-volume work, Opere 
Matematiche, discusses optics, thermodynamics, elasticity, magnetism, and electricity. 
Beltrami was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, serving as president of this 
scientific academy in 1898. He was elected to the Italian Senate a year before his death.

A variant of the classic Beltrami pseudosphere , this depiction of a breather pseudosphere , rendered by Paul 
Nylander, also has a constant negative curvature. 








Weierstrass Function 


Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass (1815-1897) 

In the early 1800s, mathematicians often thought of a continuous function f(x) as 
having a derivative (a unique tangent line) that could be specified along most points 
in the curve. In 1872, German mathematician Karl Weierstrass stunned mathematical 
colleagues at the Berlin Academy by proving this thinking to be false. His function, 
which was continuous everywhere but differentiable (possessing a derivative) nowhere, 
was defined by f(x) = X< 2 *cos(b*Trx), where the sum is from k - 0 to °°. Here, a is a 
real number with 0 < a < 1, b is an odd positive integer, and ab > (1 + 3tt/2) . The 
summation symbol 5) indicates that the function is constructed from an infinite number 
of trigonometric functions to produce a densely nested oscillating structure. 

Of course, mathematicians were well aware that functions might not be differ¬ 
entiable at a few troublesome points, such as the bottom of the inverted wedge shape 
specified by f{x) = |x|, which has no derivative at x = 0. However, after Weierstrass's 
demonstration of a nowhere-differentiable curve, mathematicians were in a quandary. 
Mathematician Charles Hermite wrote to Thomas Stieltjes in 1893, "I turn away with 
fear and horror from the lamentable plague of continuous functions that do not have 
derivatives....” 

In 1875, Paul du Bois-Reymond published the Weierstrass function, making it the 
first published function of its kind. Two years earlier, he had given a draft of the paper 
to Weierstrass to read. (The draft contained a different function f(x) = Xsin(< 2 n x)/fc”, with 
{alb) > 1 for k = 0 to <*>, which was changed before the paper was published.) 

Like other fractal shapes, the Weierstrass function displays increasing detail with 
progressive magnification. Other mathematicians, such as Czech mathematician 
Bernard Bolzano and German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, had worked on 
similar (unpublished) constructions in 1830 and 1861, respectively. Another example of 
an everywhere-continuous but nowhere-differentiable curve is the fractal Koch curve.

Paul Nylander using f a (x) = 2[srn(iTk a x)/ , jrk a j (0 < x < I; 2 < a < 3; and the sum was from k = I to 15). 







Gross Theorie du Baguenodier 

Louis Gros (c. 1837-c. 1907) 

Baguenaudier is one of die oldest-known mechanical puzzles. In 1901, English 
mathematician Henry E. Dudeney remarked, “Certainly no home should be without 
this fascinating, historic, and instructive puzzle.” 

The objective of Baguenaudier is to remove all of the rings from a stiff horizontal 
loop. On the first move, it is possible to remove one or two rings from one end of the 
wire. The entire procedure is complicated because rings must be put back onto the wire 
loop in order to remove other rings, and the procedure is repeated many times. It turns 
out that the minimum number of moves needed is (2 n+ l — 2)/3 if the number of rings 
n is even and (2 n+1 - l)/3 if n is odd. Martin Gardner writes, “Twenty-five rings require 
22,369,621 steps. Assuming that a skilled operator can do 50 steps a minute, he could 
solve the puzzle.. .in a litde more than two years.” 

According to legend, the puzzle was invented by the Chinese general Chu-ko Liang 
(A.D. 181-234) to keep his wife busy when he was away at the wars. In 1872, Louis Gros, 
a French magistrate, demonstrated an explicit connection between these rings and binary 
numbers in his booklet Theorie du Baguenodier (a spelling he preferred). Each ring can 
be represented by a binary digit: 1 for on, and 0 for off. Specifically, Gros showed that if 
the rings were in a set of known states, it was possible to compute a binary number that 
indicated exactly how many more steps were necessary and sufficient to solve the puzzle. 
Gros’s work involved one of the first examples of what is now called the Gray Code, in 
which two successive binary numbers differ in only one digit. In fact, computer scientist 
Donald Knuth wrote that Gros was the "true inventor of the Gray binary code,” which is 
today widely used to facilitate error correction in digital communications.

Instant Insanity (1966).

The ancient Baguenaudier puzzle had led to various U.S. patents from the 1970s that describe similar puzzles. 
For example, one version can be easily disassembled even if not solved . Another allows the number of rings to be 
vaned to change the difficulty level. (Figures are from U.S. patents 4,000,901 and 3,706,458.)

The Doctorate of Kovalevskaya 


Sofia Kovalevskaya (1850-1891) 

The Russian mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya made valuable contributions to 
the theory of differential equations and was the first woman in history to receive a 
doctorate in mathematics. Like most other mathematical geniuses, Sofia fell in love 
with mathematics at a very young age. She wrote in her autobiography: “The meaning 
of these concepts I naturally could not yet grasp, but they acted on my imagination, 
instilling in me a reverence for mathematics as an exalted and mysterious science which 
opens up to its initiates a new world of wonders, inaccessible to ordinary mortals.” When 
Sofia was 11 years old, tire walls of her bedroom were papered with mathematician 
Mikhail Ostrogradski s lecture notes on differential and integral analysis. 

In 1874, Kovalevskaya received her doctorate, summa cum laude, from Gottingen 
University for her work on partial differential equations, Abelian integrals, and the 
structure of the rings of Saturn. However, despite this doctorate and enthusiastic letters 
of recommendation from mathematician Karl Weierstrass, for years Kovalevskaya 
was unable to obtain an academic position because she was a woman. I lowever, she 
finally began to lecture at the University of Stockholm in Sweden m 1884, and she 
was appointed to a five-year professorship file same year. In 1888, the Paris Academy of 
Science awarded her a special prize for her theoretical treatments of rotating solids. 

Kovalevskaya also deserves a place in the history of mathematics as she was the 
first Russian female mathematician of extreme notability, the third woman in history 
to become a professor in Europe—behind Laura Bassi (1711-1778) and Maria Agnesi 
(1718-1799)—and the first woman to hold a university chair in mathematics anywhere. 
She achieved these triumphs despite harsh resistance. For example, her father forbade 
her to study mathematics, but she secretly studied at night when the family slept 
Russian women could not live apart from their families without written permission 
of the father; thus, she was forced to marry so that she could go abroad to further her 
education. Later in life, she wrote, “It is impossible to be a mathematician without being 
a poet in soul.”

Fifteen Puzzle 


Noyes Palmer Chapman (1811-1889) 

Although not a serious mathematical milestone like many of the entries in this book, 
the Fifteen Puzzle caused such a stir among the public that it is worthy of mention for 
historical reasons. Today, you can purchase a variant of the puzzle with 15 squares (tiles) 
and one vacant spot in a 4 x 4 frame or box. At the start, the squares sequentially contain 
the numbers 1 through 15 and then a gap. In a version of the puzzle in Sam Loyd's 1914 
Cyclopedia, the starting configuration had the 14 and 15 reversed. 

For Loyd, the goal was to “slide” the squares up, down, 
right, and left to arrive at the sequence 1 through 15 (with the 
14 and 15 having swapped positions). In Cyclopedia, Loyd 
claims that a prize of $1,000 was offered for the solution; alas, 
it is impossible to solve the puzzle from this starting position. 

The original version of the game, developed in 1874 by 
New York postmaster Noyes Palmer Chapman, became an 
instant success in 1880 much like the Rubik’s cube 100 years 
later. Originally, the tiles were loose, and the player placed them 
randomly, and then attempted to solve. Starting with random configurations, the puzzle 
can only be solved 50 percent of the time! 

Mathematicians have since determined precisely which initial arrangements of 
the tiles can lead to solutions. German mathematician W. Ahrens noted, “The Fifteen 
Puzzle bobbed up in the United States; it spread quickly, and owing to the uncountable 
number of devoted players it had conquered, it became a plague.” Interestingly, the 
chess superstar Bobby Fischer was an expert at solving the puzzle in less than 30 seconds 
if it started with any solvable configuration.

Cantors Transfinite Numbers 


Georg Cantor (1845-1918) 

German mathematician Georg Cantor founded modem set theory and introduced the 
mind-boggling concept of transfinite numbers that can be used to denote the relative 
“sizes” of an infinite collection of objects. The smallest transfinite number is called 
aleph-nought, written as Hq, which counts the number of integers. If the number of 
integers is infinite (with Kq members), are there yet higher levels of infinity? It turns out 
that even though there are an infinite number of integers, rational numbers (numbers 
that can be expressed as fractions), and irrational numbers (like the square root of 2 that 
cannot be expressed as a fraction), the infinite number of irrationals is in some sense 
greater than the infinite number of rationals or integers. Similarly, there are more real 
numbers (which include rational and irrational numbers) than there are integers. 

Cantor’s shocking concepts about infinity drew widespread criticism—which likely 
contributed to Cantor’s bouts of severe depression and multiple institutionalizations— 
before being accepted as a fundamental theory. Cantor also equated his concept of the 
Absolute Infinite, which transcended the transfinite numbers, with God. He wrote, “I 
entertain no doubts as to the truths of the transfinites. which I recognized with God's 
help and which, in their diversity, I have studied for more than twenty years.” In 1884, 
Cantor wrote to Swedish mathematician Costa Mittag-Leffler explaining that he was not 
the creator of his new work, but merely a reporter. God had provided the inspiration, 
leaving Cantor only responsible for the organization and style of his papers. Cantor said 
that he knew that transfinites were real because “God had told me so,” and it would have 
diminished God’s power had God only created finite numbers. Mathematician David 
Hilbert described Cantor s work as “the finest product of mathematical genius and one 
of the supreme achievements of purely intellectual human activity ”

Reuleaux Triangle 

Franz Reuleaux (1829-1905) 

The Reuleaux triangle (RT) is one example of a wide class of geometrical discoveries 
like file Mftbius Strip that did not find many practical applications until relatively late in 
humankind s intellectual development. Not until around 1875, when the distinguished 
German mechanical engineer Franz Reuleaux discussed the famous curvy triangle, did 
fire RT begin to find numerous uses. Although Reuleaux wasn't the first to draw and 
consider the shape formed from the intersection of three circles at the comers of an 
equilateral triangle, he was the first to demonstrate its constant-width properties and the 
first to use the triangle in numerous real-world mechanisms. The construction of the 
triangle is so simple that modem researchers have wondered why no one before Reuleaux 
had exploited its use. The shape is a close relative of a circle because of its constant width, 
meaning that the distance between two opposite points is always the same. 

Various technology patents have focused on drill bits that cut square holes using the 
RT. At first, the notion of a drill that creates nearly square holes defies common sense. 
How can a revolving drill bit cut anything but a circular hole? But such drill bits exist 
For example, the illustration shown here is from the 1978 patent U.S. 4,074,778 for a 
“Square Hole Drill” and is based on the RT. The RT also appears in patents for other 
drill bits as well as for novel bottles, rollers, beverage cans, candles, rotatable shelves, 
gearboxes, rotary engines, and cabinets. 

Many mathematicians have studied the Reuleaux triangle, so we know a lot about 
its properties. For example, its area is A = Yi (tt — /T )t 2 , and the area drilled by a RT 
drill bit covers 0.9877003907... of the area of an actual square. The small difference occurs 
because the Reuleaux drill bit produces a square with very slightly rounded comers.

Harmonic Analyzer 

Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830), William Thomson, Baron Kelvin 
of Largs (1824-1907) 


In the early 1800s, French mathematician Joseph Fourier found that any differentiable 
function can be represented to arbitrary accuracy by a sum of sine and cosine functions, 
no matter how complicated the function. For example, a periodic function f(x) can be 
represented by the sum of A 71 -sin(nx) + jB n -cos(nx) for amplitudes A„ and B n . 

A harmonic analyzer is a physical device for determining the coefficients and B n . 
In 1876, Lord Kelvin, a British mathematical physicist, was first to invent the harmonic 
analyzer, for the analysis of curve traces related to ocean tidal observations. A paper with 
the curve of interest is wrapped around a main cylinder. The device is made to follow 
the curve, and then the positions of various subcomponents are determined to give the 
desired coefficients. Kelvin writes that the “kinematic machine” predicts not merely “the 
times and heights of high water, but the depths of water at any instant, showing them by 
a continuous curve, for...years in advance.” Because the tides depend on the positions 
of the sun, moon, rotation of the earth, shape of the coastline, and sea floor profile, they 
can be quite complex. 

In 1894, German mathematician Olaus Henrici (1840-1918) designed a harmonic 
analyzer for determining the harmonic components of complex sound waves such 
as those from musical instruments. The device employed several pulleys and glass 
spheres connected to measuring dials that gave the phase and amplitudes of 10 Fourier 
harmonic components. 

In 1909, German engineer Otto Mader invented a harmonic analyzer that used 
gears and a pointer to trace a curve; the different gears corresponded to harmonics. The 

Montgomery harmonic analyzer of 1938 used optical and 
photoelectric means for determining the harmonic content 
of a curve. H. C. Montgomery of Bell Laboratories wrote that 
the device “is especially adapted to the analysis of speech and 
music, since it operates directly from a conventional type of 
sound track on film ”

Ritty Model I Cash Register 

James Ritty (1836-1918) 


It is difficult to imagine how retail stores could operate efficiently before cash registers 
existed. Through the decades, cash registers became increasingly sophisticated and also 
functioned as theft deterrents. It is not an exaggeration to say that they became one of 
the major transforming mechanizations of the Industrial Age. 

The first cash register was invented in 1879 by James Ritty. Ritty opened his first 
saloon in Dayton, Ohio, in 1871, referring to himself as a ''Dealer in Pure Whiskies, 
Fine Wines, and Cigars.” Ritty’s biggest challenge came from his employees who 
sometimes secretly pocketed money received from customers. 

While on a steamboat trip, Ritty studied a mechanism that counted the number of 
revolutions of the ships propeller, and he began to imagine similar mechanisms that 
might be used to record cash transactions. Ritty's early machines had two rows of keys, 
each key corresponding to a money denomination from five cents through one dollar. 
Pressing the keys turned a shaft that moved an internal counter. He patented his design 
in 1879 as “Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier.” Ritiy soon sold his cash-register business to 
a salesman named Jacob H. Eckert, and in 1884, Eckert sold the company to John H. 
Patterson, who renamed the company the National Cash Register Company. 

From Ritty’s small seed, the modem cash register grew. Patterson added paper rolls 
to record transactions using hole punchers. When a transaction was finished, a bell 
rang on the cash register and the monetary amount was represented on a large dial. In 
1906, inventor Charles F. Kettering designed a cash register with an electric motor. In 
1974, the National Cash Register Company became NCR Corp. Today, cash register 
functionality goes beyond Ritty’s wildest dream, as these number-crunching machines 
time-stamp transactions, retrieve prices from databases, and calculate appropriate tax 
amounts, various rates for preferred customers, and deductions for sale items.

Venn Diagrams 


John Venn (1834-1923) 



In 1880, John Venn, a British philosopher and cleric in the Anglican Church, devised a 
scheme for visualizing elements, sets, and logical relationships. A Venn diagram usually 
contains circular areas representing groups of items sharing common properties. For 
instance, within the universe of all real and legendary creatures (the bounding rectangle 
in the first illustration), region H represents the humans, region W the winged creatures, 
and region A the angels. A glance at the diagram reveals that (1) All angels are winged 
creatures (region A lies entirely within region W); (2) No humans are winged creatures 
(regions H and W are nonintersecting); and (3) No humans are angels (regions H and A 
are nonintersecting). 

This is a depiction of a basic rule of logic—namely, that from the statements "all A 
is W” and "no H is W,” it follows that "no H is A.” The conclusion is evident when we 
look at the circles in the diagram. 

The uses of these kinds of diagrams in logic were used before 
Venn—for example, by mathematicians Gottfried Leibniz and 
Leonhard Euler—but Venn was the first to comprehensively study 
them and formalize and generalize their usage. In fact, Venn straggled 
with generalizing symmetrical diagrams for visualizing more sets with 
intersecting areas, but he only got as far as 4 sets using ellipses. 

A century passed before Branko Griinbaum, a mathematician at the University of 
Washington, showed that rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams 
can be made from 5 congruent ellipses. The second illustration 
shows one of many different symmetrical diagrams for 5 sets. 

Mathematicians gradually realized that rotationally 
symmetric diagrams can be drawn with prime numbers of petals 
only. However, symmetrical diagrams with 7 petals were so hard 
to find that mathematicians initially doubted their existence. 

In 2001, mathematician Peter Hamburger and artist Edit Hepp 
constructed an example for 11 petals, shown on the opposite page.

Benford s Law 


Simon Newcomb (1835-1909), Frank Benford (1883-1948) 

Benford’s law, also called the first-digit law or leading-digit phenomenon, asserts that in 
various number lists, the digit 1 tends to occur in the leftmost position with probability 
of roughly 30 percent, much greater than the expected 11.1 percent that would result 
if each digit occurred with a 1 out of 9 probability. Benford’s law can be observed, for 
instance, in tables that list populations, death rates, stock prices, baseball statistics, and 
the area of rivers and lakes. Explanations for this phenomenon are very recent 

Benford’s law is named after Dr. Frank Benford, a physicist at the General Electric 
Company who publicized his work in 1938, although it had been previously discovered 
by mathematician and astronomer Simon Newcomb in 1881. Pages of logarithms with 
numbers starting with the numeral 1 are said to be dirtier and more worn than other 
pages, because the number 1 occurs as the first digit about 30 percent more often than 
any other. In numerous kinds of data, Benford determined that the probability of any 
number n from 1 through 9 being the first digit is logjo( 1 + L n )- Even the Fibonacci 
sequence—1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8,13... —follows Benford’s law. Fibonacci numbers are far 
more likely to start with “1” than any other digit It appears that Benford’s law applies to 
any data that follows a “power law.” For example, large lakes are rare, medium-size lakes 
are more common, and small lakes are even more common. Similarly, 11 Fibonacci 
numbers exist in the range 1-100, but only one in the next three ranges of 100 (101- 
200, 201-300, 301-400). 

Benford’s law has often been used to detect fraud. For example, accounting 
consultants can sometimes use the law to detect fraudulent tax returns in which the 
occurrence of digits does not follow what would naturally be expected according to 
Benford’s law.

Klein Bottle 


Felix Klein (1849-1925) 

The Klein bottle, first described in 1882 by German mathematician Felix Klein, is an 
object in which die flexible neck of a bottle wraps back into the bottle to form a shape 
with no inside and outside. This bottle is related to the Mdbius Strip, and can theoreti¬ 
cally be created by gluing two Mobius strips together along their edges. One way to 
build an imperfect physical model of a Klein bottle in our 3-D universe is to have it 
meet itself in a small, circular curve. Four dimensions are needed to create a true Klein 
bottle without self-intersections. 

Imagine your frustration if you tried to paint just the outside of a Klein bottle. You 
start painting on what seems to be the bulbous "outside” surface and work your way 
down the slim neck. The 4-D object does not self-intersect, allowing you to continue 
to follow the neck, which is now "inside” the bottle. As the neck opens up to rejoin the 
bulbous surface, you find you are now painting inside the bottle. If our universe were 
shaped like a Klein bottle, we could find paths that would cause our bodies to reverse 
when we returned after a journey, so that, for example, our hearts would be on the right 
sides of our bodies. 

Together with Toronto’s Kingbridge Centre and Killdee Scientific Glass, astronomer 
Cliff Stoll has created the world’s largest glass Klein bottle model. The Kingbridge Klein 
Bottle is about 43 inches (1.1 meters) tall and 20 inches (50 centimeters) in diameter, 
and is made of 33 pounds (15 kilograms) of clear Pyrex glass. 

Because of the peculiar properties of the Klein bottle, mathematicians and puzzle 
enthusiasts study chess games and mazes played on Klein bottle surfaces. If a map 
were drawn on a Klein bottle, six different colors would be needed to ensure that no 
bordering areas would be colored the same.

Tower of Hanoi 

Francois Edouard Anatole Lucas (1842-1891) 


The Tower of Hanoi has intrigued the world since it was invented by French mathema¬ 
tician Edouard Lucas in 1883 and sold as a toy. This mathematical puzzle consists of 
several disks of different sizes that slide onto any of three pegs. The disks are initially 
stacked on one peg in order of size, with the smallest disk at the top. When playing 
the game, one can move one disk at a time to another peg by removing the top disk in 
any stack and placing it on the top of any other stack. A disk cannot be placed on top 
of a smaller disk. The goal is to move the entire starting stack (often with eight disks) 
to another peg. The minimum number of moves turns out to be 2 n - 1, where n is the 
number of disks. 

The original game was said to be inspired by a legendary Indian Tower of Brahma, 
which employed 64 golden disks. The priests of Brahma continually moved these disks, 
using the same rules as in the Tower of Hanoi. When die last move of the puzzle is 
completed, the world will end. Note that if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of 
1 per second, then 2 64 - 1 or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 moves would require roughly 
585 billion years—many times the current estimated age of our universe. 

Simple algorithms exist for solutions involving three pegs, and the game is often 
used in computer programming classes to teach recursive algorithms. However, the 
optimal solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem with four or more pegs is still unknown. 
Mathematicians find the puzzle intriguing due to its relationships to other areas of math, 
including Gray Codes and finding Hamiltonian paths on an n-hypercube.

The Flag Tower of Hanoi, built in J8i2, is located in Hanoi, Vietnam^ It has a height of about 109.5 feet (33 A 
meters ), or 134 5 feet (41 meters) with the flag, and, according to some legends, was the likely inspiration for the 
name of the puzzle 






Flatland 


Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838-1926) 

More than a century ago, Edwin Abbott Abbott—a clergyman and the headmaster of a 
school in Victorian England—wrote an influential book describing interactions between 
creatures with access to different spatial dimensions. The book is still popular among 
mathematics students and considered useful reading for anyone studying relationships 
between such dimensions. 

Abbott encouraged readers to open their minds to new ways of perceiving. Flatland 
described a race of two-dimensional creatures, living in a flat plane, totally unaware 
of the existence of a higher dimension all around them. If we were able to look down 
on a two-dimensional world, we would be able to see inside every structure at once. A 
creature with access to a fourth spatial dimension could see inside our own bodies and 
remove a tumor without penetrating the skin. Flatlanders could be unaware that you 
were poised inches above their planar world, recording all the events of their lives. If 
you wanted to remove a Flatiander from jail, you could lift him “up” and deposit him 
elsewhere in Flatland. This act would appear miraculous to a Flatiander who would not 
even have the word up in his vocabulary. 

Today, computer graphic projections of 4-D objects bring us a step closer to higher- 
dimensional phenomena, but even the most brilliant of mathematicians are often 
unable to grasp the fourth dimension, just as the square protagonist of Flatland had 
trouble understanding the third dimension. In one oiFlatland’s most emotional scenes, 
the two-dimensional hero is confronted by the changing shapes of a three-dimensional 
being as it passes through Flatland. The square can only see the creature's cross sections. 
Abbott believed that study of the fourth spatial dimension is important in expanding our 
imagination, increasing our reverence for the universe, and increasing our humility— 
perhaps the first steps in any attempt to better understand the nature of reality or to 
glimpse the divine.

Tesseract 


Charles Howard Hinton (1853-1907) 

I know of no subject in mathematics that has intrigued both children and adults as much 
as the idea of a fourth dimension, a spatial direction different from all the directions of our 
everyday three-dimensional space. Theologians have speculated that the afterlife, heaven, 
hell, angels, and our souls could reside in a fourth dimension. Mathematicians and 
physicists frequently use the fourth dimension in their calculations. It’s part of important 
theories that describe the very fabric of our universe. 

The tesseract is the four-dimensional analog of the ordinary cube. The term 
hypercuhe is used more generally when referring to cube analogues in other dimensions. 
Just as a cube can be visualized by dragging a square into the third dimension and 
watching the shape that the square traces through space, a tesseract is produced by the 
trail of a cube moving into the fourth dimension. Although it is difficult to visualize 
a cube being shifted a distance in a direction perpendicular to all three of its axes, 
computer graphics often help mathematicians develop a better intuition for higher- 
dimensional objects. Note that a cube is bounded by square feces and a tesseract by 
cubical feces. We can write down the number of comers, edges, faces, and solids for 
these kinds of higher-dimensional objects:

The word tesseract was coined and first used in 1888 by British mathematician Charles 
Howard Hinton in his book A New Era of Thought Hinton, a bigamist, was also famous 
for his set of colored cubes that he claimed could be used to help people visualize the 
fourth dimension. When used at stances, the Hinton cubes were thought to help people 
glimpse ghosts of dead family members.

Peano Axioms 


Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) 

Schoolchildren know the simple arithmetic rules of counting, addition, and multipli¬ 
cation, but where do these simplest of rules come from, and how do we know that they 
are correct? Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano was familiar with Euclid’s five 
axioms, or assumptions, that laid the foundation for geometry, and Peano was interested 
in creating the same kind of foundation for arithmetic and number theory. The five 
Peano axioms involve non-negative integers and can be stated as: 1) 0 is a number; 

2) The successor of any number is a number; 3) If n and m are numbers and if their 
successors are equal, then n and m are equal; 4) 0 is not the successor of any number; 
and 5) If S is a set of numbers containing 0 and if the successor of any number in S is 
also in S, then S contains all the numbers. 

Peano’s fifth axiom allows mathematicians to determine whether a property is 
true of all non-negative numbers. To accomplish this, we first must show that 0 has 
the property. Next, we must show that, for any number i, if i has the property, then this 
implies that i + 1 also has the property. A metaphor helps. Imagine an infinite line of 
matches, nearly touching. If we want them all to bum, the first match must light, and 
each match in the line must be sufficiently close that it will catch fire. If one match 
along the line has too great a separation, the fire stops. With Peano’s axioms, we can 
buil d a system of arithmetic that involves an infinite set of numbers. The axioms provide 
a foundation for our number system and help mathematicians construct other number 
systems used in modem mathematics. Peano first presented his axioms in his 1889 
Arithmetices principle., nova methodo exposita (The Principles of Arithmetic, Presented 
by a New Method).

theory He taught mathematics at the University of Turin until the day before he died from a heart attack. 







Peano Curve 


Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932) 

In 1890, Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano presented one of the first examples 
of a space-filling curve. British science writer David Darling calls the discovery an 
“earthquake on the traditional structure of mathematics.” When discussing this new 
class of curves, Russian mathematician Naum Vilenkin wrote that "everything was in 
ruins, that all the basic mathematical concepts had lost their meaning.” 

The term Peano curve is often used synonymously with space-filling curve, and 
such curves can often be created by an iterative process that eventually builds a 
zigzagging line that covers the entire space in which it resides. Martin Gardner writes, 
"Peano curves were a profound shock to mathematicians. Their paths seem to be one- 
dimensional, yet at the limit they occupy a two-dimensional area. Should they be called 
curves ? To make things worse, Peano curves can be drawn just as easily to fill cubes 
and hypercubes....” Peano curves are continuous, yet like the boundary of a Koch 
Snowflake or the Weierstrass Function, no point on the curve has a unique tangent. 
Space-filling curves have a Hausdorff Dimension of 2. 

Space-filling curves have had practical applications and have suggested efficient 
routes to take when visiting a number of towns. For example, John J. Bartholdi HI, a 
professor in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Georgia Institute 
of Technology, has used Peano curves to build a routing system for an organization that 
delivers hundreds of meals to the poor and to route blood delivery by the American Red 
Cross to hospitals. Because delivery locations tend to be clustered around urban areas, 
Bartholdi’s use of space-filling curves produces very good routing suggestions because 
the curves tend to visit all the locations on a region of a map before moving on to 
another region. Scientists have also experimented with space-filling curves for weapons 
targeting because the mathematical technique can be implemented so that it runs very 
efficiently on a computer sent into orbit around the Earth.

Wallpaper Groups 

Evgraf Stepanovich Fedorov (1853-1919), Arthur Moritz Schonflies 
(1853-1928), William Barlow (1845-1934) 

The phrase "wallpaper groups” refers to ways in which a plane may be tiled so that the 
resulting pattern repeats indefinitely in two dimensions. Seventeen wallpaper patterns 
exist, each identified by symmetries such as those involving translations (for example, 
shifting or sliding) and rotations. 

The eminent Russian crystallographer E. S. Fedorov discovered and classified these 
patterns in 1891, and these patterns were also studied, independently, by the German 
mathematician A. M. Schonflies and the English crystallographer William Barlow. 
Thirteen of these patterns (formally known as isometries) include some kind of rotational 
symmetry, while four do not. Five show hexagonal symmetries. Twelve show rectangular 
symmetries. Martin Gardner writes, “Seventeen different symmetry groups [exist] that 
exhibit all the fundamentally different ways in which patterns can be repeated endlessly 
in two dimensions. The elements of these groups are simply operations performed on 
one basic pattern: sliding along the plane, rotating it, or giving it a mirror reversal. The 
seventeen symmetry groups are of great importance in the study of crystal structure” 

The geometer H. S. M. Coxeter has noted that the art of filling a plane with a 
repeated pattern reached its peak in thirteenth-century Spain, where the Islamic Moors 
used all 17 groups in their beautiful decorations of the Alhambra, a palace and fortress. 
Because some Islamic traditions discouraged the use of images of people in artworks, 
symmetrical wallpaper patterns became particularly attractive as decorations. The 
Alhambra palace in Granada contains intricate arabesque designs that decorate the tiles, 
plasterwork, and woodcarvings. 

Dutch artist M. C. Escher’s (1898-1972) visit to the Alhambra palace influenced 
his own art, which is often replete with symmetries. Escher once Said his trips to the 
Alhambra were "the richest source of inspiration I have ever tapped.” Escher tried 
to “enhance” the artworks of the Moors by using geometric grids as the basis for his 
sketches, which he then superimposed with animal designs.

Sylvester’s Line Problem 

James Joseph Sylvester (1814^1897), Tibor Callai (1912-1992) 


Sylvester's line problem—also known as Sylvester’s problem of collinear points or the 
Sylvester-Gallai theorem—stumped the entire mathematical community for forty years. 
It states that given a finite number of points in the plane, either. 1) A line exists that 
passes through exactly two of the points, or 2) All the points are collinear, or lying in the 
same straight line. English mathematician fames Sylvester made the conjecture in 1893 
but could not provide a proof. The Hungarian-bom mathematician Paul Erdos studied 
the problem in 1943, and it was correctly solved by Hungarian mathematician Tibor 
Gallai in 1944. 

Sylvester had actually asked readers to “Prove that it is not possible to arrange any 
finite number of real points so that a right line through every two of them shall pass 
through a third, unless they all lie in tire same right line.” (Sylvester used the term right 
line to indicate a straight line.) 

Stimulated by Sylvester’s conjecture, in 1951 mathematician Gabriel Andrew Dirac 
(1925-1984)—stepson of Paul Dirac and nephew of Eugene Wigner—conjectured that 
for any collection of n points, not all collinear, there exist at least n/2 lines containing 
exactly two points. Today, only two counterexamples to Diracs conjecture are known. 

Mathematician Joseph Malkevitch writes about Sylvester’s problem, “Some easy- 
to-state problems in mathematics stand out, despite their seeming simplicity, because 
initially they eluded solution.... Erdos expressed his surprise that the Sylvester problem 
went unanswered for so many years.... One seminal problem can open up many 
avenues of ideas, which even to this day are still being explored.” Sylvester said in his 
1877 address to Johns Hopkins University, “Mathematics is not a book confined within 

a cover.... It is not a mine, whose treasures.. .fill only a limited number of veins_It is 

limitless.... Its possibilities are as infinite as the worlds which are forever crowding in and 
multiplying upon the astronomer’s gaze.”

spheres)—the Sylvester-Gallai theorem tells us that there must exist at least one line containing exactly two points

Proof of the Prime Number Theorem 


Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), Jacques Salomon Hadamard 
(1865-1963), Charles-Jean de la Vallee-Poussin (1866-1962), John Edensor 
Littlewood (1885-1977) 


Mathematician Don Zagier has commented that “despite their simple definition and 
role as the building blocks of the natural numbers, the prime numbers grow like weeds 
among the natural numbers.. .and nobody can predict where the next one will sprout— 
Even more astonishing.. .the prime numbers exhibit stunning regularity, there are laws 
governing their behavior, and they obey these laws with almost military precision ” 

Consider 'ir(n), which is the number of primes less than or equal to a given number n. 
In 1792, when only 15 years old, Carl Gauss became fascinated by the occurrence of 
prime numbers, and he proposed that 'rr(n) was approximately equal to n/\n(n) 7 where 
In is the natural logarithm. One consequence of the prime number theorem is that 
the nth prime number is approximately equal to nln(n), with the relative error of this 
approximation approaching 0 as n approaches infinity. Gauss later refined his estimate 
to 7r(n) ~ Li(n) where Li(n) is the integral from 2 to n of dx/ln(x). 

Finally, in 1896, French mathematician Jacques Hadamard and Belgian mathema¬ 
tician Charles-Jean de la Vallee-Poussin independently proved Gauss’s theorem. Based on 
numerical experiments, mathematicians had conjectured that ^(n) was always somewhat 
less than Li(n). However, in 1914, Litfiewood proved that 7r(n) < Li(n) reverses infinitely 
often if one were able to search though huge values of n. In 1933, South African mathe¬ 
matician Stanley Skewes showed that the first crossing of 'ir(n) - Li(n) = 0 occur before 
10 A 10 A 10 A 34, a number referred to as Skewes’ number, where A indicates the raising to 
a power. Since 1933, this value has been reduced to around 10 316 . 

English mathematician G. H. Hardy (1877-1947) once described Skewes’ number 
as “the largest number which has ever served any definite purpose in mathematics,” 
although the Skewes’ number has since lost this lofty accolade. Around 1950, Paul Erdos 
and Atle Selberg discovered an elementary proof of the prime number theorem—that is, 
a proof that uses only real numbeR.

Picks Theorem 


Georg Alexander Pick (1859-1942) 

Pick’s theorem is delightful for its simplicity, and it can be experimented with using a 
pencil and graph paper. Draw a simple polygon on an equally spaced grid so that all of 
the vertices (comers) of the polygon fell on grid points. Pick’s theorem tells us that the 
area A of this polygon, in units squared, can be determined by counting the number i of 
points located within the polygon and the number b of boundary points located on the 
boundary of the polygon, according to A = i + b/2 - 1. Pick’s theorem does not apply to 
polygons that have holes in them. 

Austrian mathematician Georg Pick presented his theorem in 1899. In 1911, 

Pick introduced Albert Einstein to the work of relevant and key mathematicians, 
which helped Einstein to develop his general theory of relativity. When Hitler’s troops 
invaded Austria in 1938, Pick, a Jew, fled to Prague. Sadly, his flight was not sufficient 
to save his life. The Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia and sent him to the Theresienstadt 
concentration camp in 1942, where he died. Of the approximately 144,000 Jews sent 
to Theresienstadt, about a quarter died on site and around 60 percent were shipped to 
Auschwitz or other death camps. 

Mathematicians have since discovered that no direct analogue of Pick’s theorem 
exists in three dimensions that allows us to calculate the volume of a polytope (for 
example, a polyhedron) by counting its interior and boundary points. 

Using tracing paper that has a grid, we can use Pick’s theorem to estimate the areas 
of regions on a map, if we approximate the region with a polygon. British science writer 
David Darling writes: “Over the past few decades,... various generalizations of Pick’s 
theorem have been made to more general polygons, to higher-dimensional polyhedra, 
and to lattices other than square lattices... .The theorem provides a link between 
traditional Euclidean geometry and the modem subject of digital (discrete) geometry.”

Polyhedra (c. 240 B.C ).

the polygon and b is the number of boundary points located on the boundary of the polygon , 







Morley's Trisector Theorem 

Frank Morley (1860-1937) 

In 1899, Anglo-American mathematician and accomplished chess player Frank Morley 
proposed Morley’s theorem that states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection 
of adjacent angle trisectors always form an equilateral triangle. T risectors refers to 
the straight lines that divide the interior angles into three equal parts, and these lines 
intersect in six points, of which three are vertices of an equilateral triangle. Various 
proofs exist, and some of the earliest proofs were quite complicated. 

Morley's colleagues found the result so beautiful and surprising that it came to be 
known as "Morley's Miracle.” Richard Francis writes, "Apparently overlooked by ancient 
geometers or hastily abandoned because of bisection and constructability uncertainties, 
the problem came to light only a century ago. Though conjectured around 1900 by 
Frank Morley, resolution or rigorous proof was to await even more recent advances. This 
beautiful and elegant Euclidean theorem, mysteriously unnoticed across the ages, thus 
belongs to the twentieth century.” 

Morley taught at both the Quaker College in Haverford, Pennsylvania, and at 
Johns Hopkins University. In 1933, he published Inversive Geometry co-written with 
his son, the mathematician Frank V. Morley. The son wrote about his father in One 
Contribution to Chess: "He would begin to fiddle in his waistcoat pocket for a stub of 
pencil perhaps two inches long, and there would be a certain amount of scrabbling in 
a side pocket for an old envelope... until he would get up a little stealthily and make 
his way toward his study.. .and my mother would call out, ‘Frank, you’re not going to 
work!'—and the answer would always be, ‘A little, not much!’—and the study door 
would close.” 

Morley’s theorem continues to fascinate mathematicians. In 1998, Alain Connes, 
a French Fields Medalist, presented a new proof of Morley's theorem.

According to Morley's theorem—also known as Morley’s Miracle— for any triangle, the three points of 
intersection of adjacent angle trisectors always form an equilateral triangle. 





Hilberts 23 Problems 


David Hilbert (1862-1943) 

German mathematician David Hilbert wrote, "A branch of science is full of life as long 
as it offers an abundance of problems; a lack of problems is a sign of death.” In 1900, 
he presented 23 important mathematical problems to be targeted for solution in the 
twentieth century. Because of Hilbert s prestige, mathematicians spent a great deal of 
time tackling the problems through the years. His extremely influential speech on the 
subject started, “Who of us would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the future 
lies hidden; to cast a glance at the next advances of our science and at the secrets of its 
development during future centuries? What particular goals will there be toward which 
the leading mathematical spirits of coming generations will strive?” 

About ten of the problems have since been cleanly solved, and many others have 
solutions that are accepted by some mathematicians but for which some controversy 
still remains. For example, the Kepler Conjecture (part of Problem 18), which raised 
questions about the efficiency of sphere packing, involved a computer-assisted proof, 
which may be difficult for people to verify. 

One of the most famous problems still unresolved today is the Riemann Hypothesis, 
which concerns the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (a very wiggly 
function). David Hilbert remarked, “If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand 
years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?” 

Ben Yandell writes, “Solving one of Hilbert’s Problems has been the romantic 
dream of many a mathematician.... In the last hundred years, solutions and significant 
partial results have come from all over the world. Hilbert’s list is a thing of beauty, and 
aided by their romantic and historical appeal, these well-chosen problems have been an 
organizing force in mathematics.”

Chi-Square 

Karl Pearson (1857-1936) 


Scientists often obtain experimental results that do not agree with those anticipated 
according to the rules of probability. For example, when tossing a die, if the deviation 
from expectation is very large, we would say that the die is probably biased, such as 
would be the case for a die with unequally weighted sides. 

The chi-square test was first published in 1900 by British mathematician Karl 
Pearson, and his method has since been used in countless fields ranging from 
cryptography and reliability engineering to the analysis of hitting records in baseball. 
When applying the test, events are assumed to be independent (as in our die-tossing 
example). The chi-square value can be calculated once we know each observed 
frequency, 0,-> and each theoretical (i.e., expected) frequency, E ; . The formula can 
be expressed as x 2 = X(0; - E,) 2 /E,-. If the frequency of expected and observed events 
agrees exactly, then x 2 - 0. The greater the differences, the larger the value for y}. In 
practice, the significance of this difference is determined with reference to a chi-square 
table that helps researchers determine the degree of significance of the difference. Of 
course, researchers may also be suspicious if x 2 is too close to zero, and thus may look 
for values of x 2 that are either too low or too high. 

As an example, let us test the hypothesis that a random sample of 100 insects has 
been drawn from a population in which butterflies and beetles are equal in frequency. 
If we observe 10 beetles and 90 butterflies, we obtain a x 2 value of (10 - 50) 2 /50 + 

(90 - 50) 2 /50 = 64, a huge value that suggests that our initial hypothesis—that we have 
randomly drawn from a population with the same number of butterflies as beetles—is 
probably incorrect. 

Pearson received many awards for his work, although outside the field of 
mathematics he was a racist and advocated a “war” against “inferior races.”

Boys Surface 

Werner Boy (1879-1914), Bernard Morin (b. 1931) 

Boy’s surface was discovered in 1901 by German mathematician Wemer Boy. Like the 
Klein Bottle, this object is a single-sided surface with no edges. Boy’s surface is also a 
non-orientable surface, which means that a two-dimensional creature can travel within 
the surface and find paths that will reverse the creature’s handedness when it returns to 
its starting point. The Mobius Strip and Klein bottle also have non-orientable surfaces. 

Formally speaking. Boy’s surface is an immersion of a projective plane in three- 
dimensional space with no singularities (pinch points). Geometric recipes exist for its 
creation, and some of them involve the stretching of a disk and the gluing of the disk 
edge to the edge of a Mobius strip. During the process, the surface is allowed to pass 
through itself, but it may not be tom or have any pinch points. The Boy’s surface is very 
difficult to visualize, although computer graphics help researchers have a better feel for 
the shape. 

Boy’s surface has three-fold symmetry. In other words, there exists an axis about 
which the shape can be rotated by 120° and look identical. Interestingly, Boy was able 
to sketch several models of the surface, but he could not determine the equations (that 
is, a parametric model) to describe the surface. Finally, in 1978, French mathematician 
Bernard Morin used computers to find the first parameterization. Morin, who was blind 
since childhood, had a successful career in mathematics. 

Mathematics journalist Allyn Jackson writes, “Far from detracting from his 
extraordinary visualization ability, Morin’s blindness may have enhanced it.... One 
thing that is difficult about visualizing geometric objects is that one tends to see only the 
outside of the objects, not the inside, which might be very complicated.... Morin has 
developed the ability to pass from outside to inside... .Because he is so accustomed to 
tactile information, Morin can, after manipulating a hand-held model for a couple of 
hours, retain the memory of its shape for years afterward."

Barber Paradox 


Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) 

In 1901, British philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell uncovered a possible 
paradox or apparent contradiction that forced a modification to set theory. One version 
of Russell’s paradox, also known as the Barber paradox, involves a town with one male 
barber who, every day, shaves every man who doesn’t shave himself, and no one else. 
Does the barber shave himself? 

The scenario seemed to demand that the barber shave himself if and only if he does 
not shave himself! Helen Joyce writes, “The paradox raises the frightening prospect that 
the whole of mathematics is based on shaky foundations, and that no proof can be trusted" 

Russell’s paradox, in its original form, involves the set of all sets that aren’t members 
of themselves. Many sets R are not members of themselves—for example, the set of 
cubes is not a cube. Examples of sets T that do contain themselves as members are the 
set of all sets, or the set of all things except cubes. Every set would seem to be either of 
type R or of type T, and no set can be both. However, Russell wondered about the set S 
of all sets that aren’t members of themselves. Somehow, S is neither a member of itself 
nor not a member of itself. Russell realized that he had to alter set theory in a way to 
avoid such confusions and possible contradictions. 

One possible refutation of the Barber paradox seems to be that we can simply say 
that such a barber does not exist Nevertheless, Russell’s paradox led to a cleaner form of 
set theory. German mathematician Kurt Godel made use of similar observations when 
forming his incompleteness theorem. British mathematician Alan Turing also found 
Russell’s work useful when studying the undecidability of the halting problem, which 
concerns the assessment of whether or not a computer program will finish in a finite 
number of steps.

Jung’s Theorem 

Heinrich Wilhelm Ewald Jung (1876-1953) 

Imagine a finite set of scattered points, as you might see in a map of a constellation of 
stars or randomly placed drops of ink on a page. Draw a line between the two points that 
have the greatest separation. This largest possible distance d between two points is called 
the geometric span of the set of points. Jung’s theorem says that no matter how strangely 
scattered the points are, they are guaranteed to be enclosed by a circle with a radius no 
greater than dlj 3. In the case of points arranged along the sides of an equilateral triangle 
with a side length of 1 unit, the enclosing circle touches all three vertices (comers) of 
the triangle and has a radius of 1A/3. 

Jung’s theorem may be generalized to three dimensions in which the set of points 
can be enclosed by a sphere with a radius no greater than J6 d/4 . This means, for 
example, that if we have a collection of point-like objects in space, such as a flock of 
birds or a school of fish, then these objects are guaranteed to be enclosable by such a 
sphere. Jung’s theorem has since been extended to various Non-Euclidean Geometries 
and spaces. 

If we want to move the theorem into more mind-boggling territories, such as 
encapsulating birds in higher-dimensional hyperspheres of dimension n, we can resort to 
the wonderfully compact formula 

which means that a four-dimensional hypersphere of radius djlIS is guaranteed to 
trap a flock of starlings that are flying with access to the fourth dimension. German 
mathematician Heinrich Jung studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the 
University of Marburg and at the University of Berlin from 1895 to 1899, and he 
published his theorem in 1901.

Poincare Conjecture 

Henri Poincare (1854-1912), Grigori Perelman (b. 1966) 


The Poincare conjecture, posed in 1904 by French mathematician Henri Poincar6, 
concerns topology, the branch of mathematics involving the study of shapes and their 
interrelations. In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute offered $1 million for a proof of 
this conjecture, which can be conceptually visualized at a high level in terms of oranges 
and doughnuts. Imagine a loop of string wrapped around an orange. In theory, we can 
slowly shrink the loop to a point without tearing the string or the orange, and without 
the string leaving the surface of the orange. However, if a string is wrapped around a 
doughnut through its hole, the string can't be shrunk to a point without breaking the 
string or the doughnut. The surface of die orange is called simply connected, and the 
doughnut surface is not. Poincare understood that a two-dimensional spherical shell 
(for example, modeled by the orange surface) is simply connected, and he asked if a 
three-dimensional sphere (the set of points in four-dimensional space that are the same 
distance away from a single point) has the same properties. 

Finally, in 2002 and 2003, Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman proved the 
conjecture. Oddly enough, Perelman showed little interest in collecting the prize and 
simply placed his solution on the Internet rather than publishing it in a mainstream 
journal. In 2006, Perelman was awarded the prestigious Fields Medal for his solution, 
but he rejected the award, saying that it was "completely irrelevant” for him. For 
Perelman, if the proof was correct “then no other recognition is needed.” 

Science magazine reported in 2006, "Perelman’s proof has fundamentally altered 
two distinct branches of mathematics. First, it solved a problem that for more than a 
century was the indigestible seed at the core of topology.... [Second], the work will 
lead to a much broader result.. .a ‘periodic table’ that brings clarity to the study of three- 
dimensional spaces, much as Mendeleev’s table did for chemistry.”

Koch Snowflake 


Niels Fabian Helge von Koch (1870-1924) 

The Koch snowflake is often one of the first fractal objects to which students are 
exposed, and it is also among the earliest fractal objects described in the history of 
mathematics. The intricate shape appears in Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch’s 
1904 paper “On a Continuous Curve without Tangents, Constructible from Elementary 
Geometry.” A related object, the Koch curve, starts with a line segment instead of an 
equilateral triangle for the process used to generate the curve. 

To create the crinkly Koch curve, we may recursively alter a line segment watching 
it sprout an infinite amount of edges in the process. Imagine splitting a line into three 
equal parts. Next replace the middle portion with two lines, both of the same length 
as the first three, so that they form a V-shaped wedge (the top edges of an equilateral 
triangle). The shape now consists of four straight lines. For each of these lines, repeat 
the process of splitting and forming wedges. 

Starting with a line 1 inch in length, the length of the growing curve at step n in 
the procedure is (4/3)" inches. After a few hundred iterations, the length of the curve 
becomes longer than the diameter of the visible universe. In feet, foe "final” Koch curve 
has infinite length and a fractal dimension of about 1.26, because it partially fills foe 2-D 
plane in which it is drawn. 

Even though foe edge of a Koch snowflake has an infinite length, it encloses a finite 
area (273s 2 )/5, where s is foe original side length, or equivalently, the area is simply 8/5 
times foe area of foe original triangle. Note that a function has no definite tangent at a 
comer, which means that a function is not differentiable (has no unique derivatives) at 
comers. The Koch curve is non-differentiable everywhere (because it is so pointyl), even 
though foe curve is continuous.

Zermelo’s Axiom of Choice 


Ernst Friedrich Ferdinand Zermelo (1871-1953) 

David Darling calls this axiom in set theory “one of the most controversial axioms in 
mathematics.'’ The axiom was formulated in 1904 by the German mathematician Ernst 
Zermelo, who was later appointed to an honorary chair at the University of Freiburg, 
which he renounced in protest of Hitler’s regime. 

While complex to write mathematically, the axiom can be visualized using a 
long shelf of goldfish bowls. Each bowl must contain at least one goldfish. The axiom 
of choice (AC) simply says that you can always choose, in theory, one goldfish from 
each bowl, even if there are infinitely many bowls, even if we have no “rule” for which 
goldfish to pluck from each bowl, and even if the goldfish are indistinguishable. 

Using mathematical language, if S is a collection of non-empty sets having no 
element in common, then a set must exist that has exactly one element in common with 
every set s of S. Looking at this another way, there exists a choice function f with the 
property that, for each set s in the collection, f(s) is a member of s. 

Before the AC, there was no reason to believe that we could always find a mathema¬ 
tical rationale for which fish to pick from the bowls if some of the bowls had infinitely 
many fish, or at least no reason to think that we could always find a rationale that would 
take less than an infinite amount of time to use. It turns out that the AC is at the core 
of many important mathematical theorems in algebra and topology, and most mathe¬ 
maticians today accept AC because it is so useful. Eric Schecter writes, “When we 
accept AC, this means we are agreeing to the convention that we shall permit ourselves 
to use a hypothetical choice function f in proofs, as though it 'exists’ in some sense, even 
in cases where we cannot give an explicit example of it or an explicit algorithm for it.”

Jordan Curve Theorem 

Marie Ennemond Camille Jordan (1838-1922), Oswald Veblen (1880-1960) 

Find a loop of wire, twist it in a very convoluted fashion that does not include any self- 
intersections, and lay it flat on a table to create a maze of sorts. You place an ant in the 
structure. If the maze is sufficiently complex, it is visually difficult to determine if the 
ant is inside or outside the loop. One way to determine if the ant is within the loop is to 
count the number of times an imaginary straight line drawn from the ant to the outside 
world crosses the wire. If the line crosses the curve an even number of times, the ant is 
outside the maze; if an odd number of times, the ant is inside. 

French mathematician Camille Jordan researched these kinds of rules for determin¬ 
ing the inside and outside of curves, and he is most famous for his theorem showing that a 
simply closed curve divides a plane into an inside and outside, now called the Jordan curve 
theorem (JCT). Although this may seem obvious, Jordan realized that a rigorous proof 
was necessary and difficult Jordan’s work with curves appeared in his Cours d’analyse de 
I'ftcole Polytechnique (Analysis Course from the ftcole Polytechnique), first published in 
three volumes between 1882 and 1887. The JCT appeared in the third edition of the text, 
published between 1909 and 1915. American mathematician Oswald Veblen is usually 
credited with being the first to provide a precise proof of the JCT, in 1905. 

Note that a Jordan curve is a plane curve that is a deformed circle, and it must be 
simple (the curve cannot cross itself) and closed (has no endpoints and also completely 
encloses an area). On a plane or sphere, Jordan curves have an inside and outside—and 
to get from one to the other, at least one line must be crossed. However, on a torus (the 
surface of a doughnut shape), Jordan curves do not necessarily exhibit this property.

Thue-Morse Sequence 

Axel Thue (1863-1922), Marston Morse (1892-1977) 

The Thue-Morse (TM) sequence is a binary sequence that begins 01101001.... In my 
book Mazes for the Mind, when the sequence is converted to sounds, one character 
remarks, “It’s the strangest thing ye ever heard. It ain’t exactly irregular and it ain't 
exactly regular, either.” The sequence is named in honor of the Norwegian mathema¬ 
tician Axel Thue and American mathematician Marston Morse. In 1906, Thue 
introduced the sequence as an example of an aperiodic, recursively computable string 
of symbols. In 1921, Morse applied it to his studies of differential geometry, and 
numerous fascinating properties and applications have since been discovered. 

One way to generate the sequence is to start with a zero and then repeatedly do 
the following replacements: 0 -»-01 and 1 -*■ 10 to produce the following successive 
generations: 0,01, 0110,01101001, 0110100110010110....Notice that some terms, 
such as the third term 0110, are palindromes (sequences that read the same backward 
or forward). 

You can generate the sequence in another way: Each generation is obtained from 
the preceding one by appending its complement. For example, if you see a 0110, you 
append to it a 1001. You can also generate the sequence by starting with the numbers 0, 
1,2, 3,... and writing them in binary notation: 0,1,10,11,100,101,110, 111, — Next, 
calculate die sum of the digits modulo 2 for each binary number—that is, divide the sum 
by 2 and use the remainder. This also yields the TM sequence: 0,1,1, 0,1, 0, 0,1,... 

The sequence is self-similar. For example, retaining every other term of the infinite 
sequence reproduces die sequence. Retaining every other pair also reproduces the 
sequence. In other words, you take the first two numbers, skip the next two numbers, 
and so forth. Although aperiodic, the sequence is anything but random. It has strong 
short-range and long-range structures. For example, there can never be more than two 
adjacent terms that are identical.

Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem 


Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer (1881-1966) 

David Darling refers to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem as “an amazing result in 
topology and one of the most useful theorems in mathematics.” Max Beran says the 
theorem “takes his breath away.” In order to help visualize the theorem, imagine 
we have two sheets of graph paper of the same size, one atop the other. Your messy 
roommate takes one piece, crumples it into a messy blob, and tosses it onto the other 
sheet so that no piece of the blob extends beyond the edge of the bottom paper. The 
theorem states that at least one point exists in the blob that lies exactly above the same 
position on the bottom sheet where it was originally. (We assume that the roommate 
does not tear the paper.) 

The same theorem works in other dimensions. Imagine a ball-shaped lemonade bowl 
with an opening on top. Your messy roommate stirs the lemonade. Even if all the points in 
the liquid move, Brouwer 7 s theorem insists that there must be some point in the lemonade 
that is in exactly the same spot as it was before your roommate started stirring. 

In the more precise language of mathematics, the theorem states that a continuous 
function from an n-ball into an n-balJ (where n > 0 is the dimension) must have a 
fixed point 

Dutch mathematician Luitzen Brouwer proved the theorem for the case for 
n * 3 in 1909. French mathematician Jacques Hadamard proved the general case in 
1910. According to Martin Davis, Brouwer was often combative, and toward the end of 
his life Brouwer became isolated and "under the spell of totally unfounded financial 
worries and a paranoid fear of bankruptcy, persecution, and illness.” He was hit by a car 
and killed in 1966 while crossing the street.

Normal Number 

Felix Edouard Justin Emile Borel (1871-1956) 


The search for patterns in the endless stream of digits in numbers like ir is an ongoing 
quest for mathematicians. Mathematicians conjecture that tt is “normal,” which means 
that any finite pattern of digits occurs with the same frequency as would be found for a 
completely random sequence. 

The quest for possible patterns in t r played a lcey role in Carl Sagan’s novel 
Contact , in which aliens coded a picture of a circle in the digits of tt. The theological 
implications are intriguing, making the reader wonder if the universe could have 
been carefully constructed to reveal messages in the constants of nature. In fact, if it 
is a normal number, somewhere inside its endless digits is almost surely a very close 
representation for all of us—the atomic coordinates of all our atoms, our genetic code, 
all our thoughts, all our memories. Be happy: tt makes us immortal! 

Sometimes mathematicians use the phrase "absolutely normal” to denote normality 
in every base and “simply normal” if the number is normal in a particular base. (For 
example, our decimal system is “base 10” because it uses the 10 digits, 0 through 9.) 
Normality means that all digits are equally likely, all pairs of digits equally likely, all 
triplets of digits equally likely, and so forth. For example, for tt, the digit 7 is expected 
to appear roughly 1 million times among the first 10 million digits of its decimal 
expansion. It actually occurs 1,000,207 times, which is very close to the expected value. 

French mathematician and politician Emile Borel introduced the concept of 
normal numbers in 1909 as a way to characterize the digits of rr, which seemed to 
have the properties of a random string of digits. In 1933, the artificially constructed 
Champemowne’s Number was one of the first numbers found to be normal in base 10. 
The first absolutely normal number was constructed by Wadaw Sierpihski in 1916. As 
is the case for tt, it is conjectured, but not yet proved, that the numbers J2, e, and ln(2) 
are also normal.

Booles Philosophy and Fun 
of Algebra 

Maiy Everest Boole (1832-1916) 

Mary Everest Boole was a self-taught mathematician, known for her intriguing 1909 
book Philosophy and Fun of Algebra. She was the wife of George Boole (1815-1864), 
the British mathematician and philosopher who invented Boolean Algebra, which 
became the foundation for modem computer arithmetic. She was also responsible 
for editing his monumental 1854 book Laws of Thought Her Philosophy and Fun of 
Algebra gives modem historians a glimpse of math education during the early 1900s. 

At one point in her life, Mary worked at Queens College, the first women’s college 
in England. Alas, she lived in an era when women were not allowed to receive degrees 
or teach at the college. Although she desperately wanted to teach, she accepted a job 
working at a library, where she advised many students. Her perseverance and zeal for 
mathematics and education make her a hero in the eyes of some modem-day feminists. 

Toward the end of her book, she discusses imaginary numbers, like J-T, which 
she treats with mystic reverence: “[A top Cambridge mathematics student] got thinking 
about the square root of minus one as if it were a reality, till he lost his sleep and 
dreamed that he was the square root of minus one and could not extract himself; and 
he became so ill that he could not go to his examination at all.” She also writes that 
“Angels, and the square roots of negative quantities... are messengers from the As-Yet- 
Unknown; and come to tell us where we are to go next; and the shortest road to get 
there; and where we ought not to go just at present.” 

Mathematics seemed to be in the Boole blood. Mary’s oldest daughter married 
Charles Howard Hinton (1853-1907), who also provided mystical.interpretations of 
tesseracts and tools for visualizing the fourth dimension. Another daughter, Alicia, is 
famous for work with polytopes, a term that she coined and that refers to generalizations 
of polygons to higher dimensions.

Principia Mathematica 

Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) 

British philosophers and mathematicians Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead 
collaborated for eight years to produce their landmark work Principia Mathematica 
(three volumes, nearly 2,000 pages, 1910-1913), which aimed to demonstrate that 
mathematics can be stated using concepts of logic such as class and membership in a 
class. The Principia attempted to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference 
rules in symbolic logic. 

The Modem Library ranks Principia as the twenty-third most important nonfiction 
book of the twentieth century, in a list that includes such books as James Watson's The 
Double Helix and William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience. According to 
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Written as a defense of logicism (i.e., the 
view that mathematics is in some significant sense reducible to logic), the book was 
instrumental in developing and popularizing modem mathematical logic. It also served 
as a major impetus for research in the foundations of mathematics throughout the 
twentieth century. Next to Aristotle's Organon , it remains the most influential book on 
logic ever written.” 

Although Principia succeeded in providing derivations of many major theorems 
in mathematics, some critics were nervous about some the book’s assumptions, such as 
the axiom of infinity (that is, there exists an infinite number of objects), which seemed 
to be an empirical assumption rather than a logical one. Therefore, it is still an open 
question as to whether mathematics can be reduced to logic. Nevertheless, Principia was 
extremely influential in emphasizing the connections between logicism and traditional 
philosophy, thus catalyzing new research in diverse areas of philosophy, mathematics, 
economics, linguistics, and computer science. 

In Principia, after a few hundred pages, the authors prove that 1 + 1 = 2. Cambridge 
University Press, the publisher of the book, had decided that publishing Principia would 
result in an estimated loss of 600 pounds. Only after the authors agreed to give some 
money to Cambridge was the book published.

Hairy Ball Theorem 

Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer (1881-1966) 

In 2007, materials scientist Francesco Stellacci of die Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology made use of the hairy ball theorem (HBT) in mathematics to force 
nanoparticles to stick together to form long chainlike structures. According to a very 
high-level view of the theorem, first proved in 1912 by Dutch mathematician Luitzen 
Brouwer, if a sphere is covered in hair and we try to smoothly brush those hairs to make 
them all lie flat, we will always leave behind at least one hair standing up straight or a 
hole (for example, a bald spot). 

Stellacci's team covered gold nanoparticles with sulfurous molecular hairs. Because 
of the HBT, hairs were likely to protrude in one or more locations, and these points 
became unstable defects on the particle surfaces, making it easy to substitute these 
standouts with chemicals that behaved as handles so that the particles could stick to one 
another, and perhaps someday be used to form nanowires in electronics devices. 

Using mathematical language, the HBT states that any continuous tangent vector 
field on the sphere must have at least one point where the vector field is zero. Consider 
a continuous function f that assigns a vector in 3-D space to every point p on a sphere 
such that f(p) is always tangent to the sphere at p. This means that at least one p exists 
such that f(p) = 0. In other words, “the hair on a fur ball can’t be brushed so that it lies 
flat at every point ” 

The implications of the theorem are intriguing. For example, since wind may be 
thought of as vectors with magnitudes and directions, the theorem states that somewhere 
on the Earth’s surface, the horizontal wind speed must be zero, no matter how windy 
it is at every other location. Interestingly, the hairy ball theorem does not apply to the 
surface of a torus (for example, a doughnut surface), and thus it is theoretically possible 
to create an admittedly unappetizing hairy doughnut where all the hairs lie flat.

If we try to smoothly brush the hairs on a hairy sphere to make them all lie flat, we will always leave behind at 
least one hair standing up straight or a hole (for example, a bald spot). 







Infinite Monkey Theorem 

F6lix Edouard Justin Emile Borel (1871-1956) 


The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey pressing keys at random on a 
typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a particular 
finite text, such as the Bible. Let us consider a single biblical phrase, “In the beginning, 
God created the heavens and the earth ” How long would it take a monkey to type this 
phrase? Assume that there are 93 symbols on a keyboard. The phrase contains 56 letters 
(counting spaces and the period at the end). If the probability of hitting the correct key 
on the typewriter is 1/n, where n is the number of possible keys, then the probability 
of the monkey correctly typing 56 consecutive characters in the target phrase is, on 
average, 1/93 56 , which means that the monkey would have to try more than 10 100 times, 
on average, before getting it right! If the monkey pressed one key per second, he’d be 
typing for well over the current age of the universe. 

Interestingly, if we were to save characters that are typed correctly, the monkey 
would obviously require many fewer keystrokes. Mathematical analysis reveals that the 
monkey, after only 407 trials, would have a 50/50 chance that the correct sentence was 
typed! This crudely illustrates how evolution can produce remarkable results when 
harnessing nonrandom changes by preserving useful features and eliminating non- 
adaptive ones. 

French mathematician Emile Borel mentioned the "dactylographic” (that is, 
typewriting) monkeys in a 1913 article, in which he commented on the likelihood 
of one million monkeys typing 10 hours a day to produce books in a library. The 
physicist Arthur Eddington wrote in 1928, “If an army of monkeys were strumming on 
typewriters, they might write all the books in the British Museum. The chance of their 
doing so is decidedly more favorable than the chance of [all gas molecules in a vessel 
suddenly moving to] one half of the vessel."

(1900), and The Rise of Randomizing Machines (1938).

Bieberbach Conjecture 

Ludwig Georg Elias Moses Bieberbach (1886-1982), Louis de Branges 
de Bourcia (b. 1932) 


The Bieberbach conjecture is associated with two colorful personalities: the vicious Nazi 
mathematician Ludwig Bieberbach, who made the conjecture in 1916, and Ftench- 
American Louis de Branges, a loner mathematician who proved the conjecture in 1984, 
although some mathematicians were initially skeptical of de Branges' work because he 
had earlier announced false results. Author Karl Sabbagh writes of de Branges, “He may 
not be a crank, but he is cranky. ‘My relationships with my colleagues are disastrous,' he 
told me. And he does seem to have left a trail of disgruntled, irritated, and even contem¬ 
ptuous colleagues behind him if only because he makes no concessions to students 
and colleagues who are not familiar with the field in which he works.” 

Bieberbach was an active Nazi and involved in the repression of Jewish colleagues, 
including German mathematicians Edmund Landau and Issai Schur. Bieberbach said 
that “representatives of overly different races do not mix as students and teachers.. 

I find it surprising that Jews are still members of academic commissions.” 

The Bieberbach conjecture states that if a function provides a one-to-one asso¬ 
ciation between points in the unit circle and points in a simply connected region of the 
plane, the coefficients of the power series that represents the function are never larger 
than the corresponding power. In other words, we are given f(z) = Oq + upz + + 

ay? ■+■ .... If do = 0 and a\ = \, then |a n | ^ n for each n ^ 2. A “simply connected 
region” may be quite complicated, but it may not contain any holes. 

De Branges says about his mathematical approach, “My mind is not very flexible. 

I concentrate on one thing, and I am incapable of keeping an overall picture. [If I omit 
something] then I have to be very careful with myself that I don’t fall into some sort of 
a depression....” The Bieberbach conjecture is significant partly because it challenged 
mathematicians for 68 years, and during this time, it inspired significant research.

Nazi mathematician Ludwig Bieberbach made his famous conjecture in 1916, and it was not proved until 1984.

Johnson s Theorem 

Roger Arthur Johnson (1890-1954) 


Johnson's theorem states that if three identical circles pass through a common point, then 
their other three intersections must lie on another circle that is of the same size as the 
original three circles. The theorem is notable not only for its simplicity but also because 
it was apparently not “discovered” until 1916 by the American geometer Roger Johnson. 
David Wells writes that this relatively recent finding in the history of mathematics 
“suggests a wealth of geometrical properties still lie hidden, waiting to be discovered.” 

Johnson is the author of Johnson's Modem Geometry: An Elementary Treatise on the 
Geometry of the Triangle and the Circle. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1913, 
and from 1947 to 1952 he served as chairman of the Mathematics Department of the 
Brooklyn branch of Hunter College, which later became Brooklyn College. 

The idea that very simple yet profound mathematics can still be discovered even 
today is not as far-fetched as it sounds. For example, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, 
in the mid to late 1900s, seemed to overflow with simple but novel ideas that quickly 
led to new branches of mathematics such as those that include cellular automata 
theory and the Monte Carlo method. Another example of simplicity and profundity are 
Penrose Tilings, the pattern of tiles discovered around 1973 by Roger Penrose. These 
tiles can completely cover an infinite surface in a pattern that is always non-repeating 
(aperiodic). Aperiodic tiling was first considered merely a mathematical curiosity, but 
physical materials were later found in which the atoms were arranged in the same 
pattern as a Penrose tiling, and now the field plays an important role in chemistry and 
physics. We should also consider the intricate and strikingly beautiful behavior of the 
Mandelbrot Set, a complicated fractal object described by a simple formula, z = z 2 + c, 
and unearthed toward the end of the twentieth century.

According to Johnsons theorem, if three identical circles pass through a common point, then their other three 
intersections must lie on another circle that is of the same size as the original three circles 






Hausdorff Dimension 


Felix Hausdorff (1868-1942) 

The Hausdorff dimension was introduced in 1918 by the mathematician Felix Hausdorff 
and can be used to measure the fractional dimensions of fractal sets. In everyday life, we 
usually think about the whole-number topological dimensions of smooth objects. For 
example, a plane is two-dimensional because a point on a plane can be described by two 
independent parameters, for example, locations along an x- and y-axis. A straight line is 
one-dimensional. 

For certain more complicated sets and curves, the Hausdorff dimension provides 
another way to define dimension. For example, imagine a line that zigzags and twists 
in such an intricate way that it par tially fills the plane. Its Hausdorff dimension increases 
beyond 1 and takes on values that get closer and closer to 2 the more the line fills 
the plane. 

Space-filling curves like the infinitely convoluted Peano Curves have a Hausdorff 
dimension of 2. The Hausdorff dimensions of coastlines vary from about 1.02 for 
the coastline of South Africa to 1.25 for the west coast of Great Britain. In fact, one 
definition of a fractal is a set for which the Hausdorff dimension exceeds the topological 
dimension. The use of fractional dimensions to quantify roughness, scaling behavior, 

'and intricacy has been demonstrated in such diverse areas as art, biology, and geology. 

Hausdorff, a Jew, was a professor of mathematics at the University of Bonn, and was 
one of the founders of modem topology and famous for his work in functional analysis 
and set theory. In 1942, when he was about to be sent to a concentration camp by the 
Nazis, he committed suicide together with his wife and sister-in-law. The day before, 
Hausdorff wrote a friend, “Forgive us. We wish you and all our friends will experience 
better times.” Many of the approaches used to compute the Hausdorff dimension 
for intricate sets were formulated by another Jew, the Russian mathematician Abram 
Samoilovitch Besicovitch (1891—1970), and hence the term Hausdorff-Besicovitch 
dimension is sometimes used.

BruiTs Constant 


Viggo Brun (1885-1978) 

Martin Gardner writes, “No branch of number theory is more saturated with mystery 
than the study of prime numbers: those exasperating, unruly integers that refuse to be 
divided evenly by any integers except themselves and 1. Some problems concerning 
primes are so simple that a child can understand them and yet so deep and far from 
solved that many mathematicians now suspect they have no solution.... Perhaps number 
theory, like quantum mechanics, has its own uncertainty principle that makes it 
necessary, in certain areas, to abandon exactness for probabilistic formulations.” 

Primes often occur as pairs of consecutive odd integers such as 3 and 5. In 2008, the 
largest known twin primes contained more than 58,000 digits each. Although infinitely 
many twin primes may exist, this conjecture remains unproven. Perhaps because the 
twin prime conjecture is a major unsolved problem, the movie The Mirror Has Two Faces 
features a math professor played by Jeff Bridges who explains the conjecture to Barbra 
Streisand. 

In 1919, Norwegian mathematician Viggo Brun proved that if we add together the 
reciprocals of successive twin primes, the sum converges to a specific numerical value, 
now called Brun’s constant B = (1/3 +1/5) + (1/5 + 1/7) + ... 1.902160....Given 

that the sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers diverges to infinity, it is fascinating 
that the twin prime sum converges—that is, approaches a definite finite value. This in 
turn suggests the relative “scarcity” of twin primes, even though an infinite set of twin 
primes may exist Today, the quest for twin primes, as well as for increasingly accurate 
values for B, continues in several universities. Other than the first pair, all pairs of twin 
primes have the form (6n - 1, 6n + 1). 

Andrew Granville remarks, “Prime numbers are the most basic objects in mathe¬ 
matics. They also are among the most mysterious, for after centuries of study, the 
structure of the set of prime numbers is still not well understood....”

Googol 


Milton Sirotta (1911-1981), Edward Kasner (1878-1955) 

The term googol , which stands for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, was coined 
by nine-year-old Milton Sirotta. Milton and his brother Edwin worked for most of 
their lives in their father’s factory in Brooklyn, New York, pulverizing apricot pits to 
form an abrasive used for industrial purposes. Sirotta was the nephew of American 
mathematician Edward Kasner, who popularized the term after he asked Milton 
to make up a word for a very large number. The word googol first appeared in print 
publications in 1938. 

Kasner is famous for being the first Jew appointed to a faculty position in the 
sciences at Columbia University and for his coauthoring of the book Mathematics 
and the Imagination , in which he introduced googol to a wide nontechnical audience. 
Although googol is of no special significance in mathematics, it has proven to be very 
useful for comparing large quantities, and for stimulating awe in the public mind as to 
the wonders of mathematics and the vast universe in which we live. It has also changed 
the world in other ways. Larry Page, one of the founders of the Internet search engine 
Google, was intrigued by mathematics and named his company after googol, after 
accidentally misspelling the word. 

A little more than a googol different ways exist to arrange 70 items in a sequence, 
such as 70 people waiting in line to enter a doorway. Most scientists agree that if we 
could count all the atoms in all the stars we can see, we would have for less than a 
googol atoms. A googol years are required for all the black holes in the universe to 
evaporate. However, the number of possible chess games is more than a googol. The 
term googolplex is 1 followed by a googol number of zeros. It has more digits than there 
are atoms in stars in the visible universe.

A little more than a googol different ways exist for arranging the 70 beads in sequence, assuming that each bead 
is different and that the necklace remains often. 





Antoine’s Necklace 


Louis Antoine (1888-1971) 

Antoine’s necklace is a gorgeous mathematical object that may be represented as chains 
within chains within chains.... The necklace can be constructed by first considering 
a solid torus, or doughnut shape. Within the torus, we construct a chain C of n 
components (links). Next, we modify each link of chain C so that it is actually another 
chain Cj of n solid tori. In each link of Cj, we construct a smaller chain of solid tori 
embedded in each link. Continue the process forever to create the delicate necklace 
of tori whose diameters decrease to zero. 

Mathematicians refer to Antoine’s necklace as homeomorphic with a Cantor set. 
Two geometrical objects are called homeomorphic if the first can be deformed into the 
second by stretching and bending. For example, we can smoothly deform a malleable, 
clay doughnut into the shape of a coffee cup without any tearing through the clay and 
pasting parts together again. The hole in the doughnut becomes the space m the handle 
for the coffee cup. The Cantor set, introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor 
in 1883, is a special set of points with infinitely many gaps between them. 

French mathematician Louis Antoine lost his sight at the age of 29 in World War I. 
Mathematician Henri Lebesgue advised Antoine to study two- and three-dimensional 
topology, because “in such a study, die eyes of die spirit and the habit of concentration 
will replace the lost vision.” Antoine’s necklace is notable because it is the first 
“wild embedding” of a set in three-dimensional space. Using Antoine’s ideas, James 
Alexander invented his famous Homed Sphere. 

Beverly Brechner and John Mayer write, “The tori are used to construct Antoine’s 
Necklace, but no torus is actually contained in Antoine’s Necklace. Only the heads,’ 
the intersections of (infinitely many) solid tori, are left. Antoine’s Necklace is totally 
disconnected.. .because for any two different points, there is some stage of construction 
such that the two points will lie in different tori....”

Noether s Idealtheorie 


Amalie Emmy Noether (1882-1935) 

Despite the horrible prejudice they faced, several women have fought against the 
establishment and persevered in mathematics. German mathematician Emmy Noether 
was described by Albert Einstein as "the most significant creative mathematical genius 
thus for produced since the higher education of women began.” 

In 1915, while at the University of Gottingen, Germany, Noether’s first significant 
mathematical breakthrough was in theoretical physics. In particular, Noether’s theorem 
dealt with symmetry relationships in physics and their relationship to conservation laws. 
This and related work was an aid to Einstein when he developed his general theory of 
relativity, which focused on the nature of gravity, space, and time. 

After Noether had received her Ph.D.. she attempted to teach at Gottingen, but 
her opponents said that men could not expect to leam “at the feet of a woman.” Her 
colleague David Hilbert replied to her detractors, "I do not see that the sex of the 
candidate is against her admission as a privatdozent [licensed lecturer]. After all, the 
university senate is not a bathhouse.” 

Noether is also known for her contributions to noncommunicative algebras, where 
the order in which terms are multiplied affects the results. She is most famous for 
her study of “chain conditions on ideals of rings,” and, in 1921, Noether published 
Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen, which is of major importance in the development of 
modem abstract algebra. This area of mathematics examines the general properties 
of operations and often unifies logic and number theory with applied mathematics. 
Alas, in 1933, her mathematical achievements were utterly dismissed when the Nazis 
terminated her from the University of Gottingen because she was Jewish. 

She fled Germany and joined the faculty at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. 
According to journalist Siobhan Roberts, Noether “made weekly trips to lecture at 
Princeton's institute, and to visit her friends Einstein and Herman Weyl ” Her influence 
was for and wide, and many of her ideas appeared in papers written by students and 
colleagues.

Lost in Hyperspace 

George P6lya (1887-1985) 

Imagine a robotic beetle placed in a twisting tube. The creature executes an infinite 
random walk by walking forever as it moves randomly one step forward or one step back 
in the tube. Assume that the tube is infinitely long. What is the probability that the 
random walk will eventually take the beetle back to its starting point? 

In 1921, Hungarian mathematician George Polya proved that the answer is 
one—infinite likelihood of return for a one-dimensional random walk. If the beetle were 
placed at the origin of a two-space universe (a plane), and then the beetle executed an 
infinite random walk by taking a random step north, south, east, or west, the probability 
that the random walk would eventually take the beetle back to the origin is also one. 

P6lya also showed that our three-dimensional world is special: Three-dimensional 
space is the first Euclidean space in which it is possible for the beetle to get hopelessly 
lost The beetle, executing an infinite random walk in a three-space universe, will 
eventually come back to the origin with a 0.34 or 34 percent probability. In higher 
dimensions, the chances of returning are even slimmer, about l/(2n) for large dimen¬ 
sions n. This l/(2n) probability is the same as the probability that the beetle would 
return to its starting point on its second step. If the beetle does not make it home in 
early attempts, it is probably lost in space forever. 

Pdlya’s parents were Jewish but had converted to Roman Catholicism the year 
before his birth. He was born in Budapest, Hungary, and in the 1940s became a 
professor of mathematics at Stanford University. His book How to Solve It sold more 
than one million copies, and he is considered by many to be among the most influential 
mathematicians of the twentieth century.

Geodesic Dome 


Walther Bauersfeld (1879-1959), Richard Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller 

(1895-1983) 

A geodesic dome can be created by triangulating a Platonic Solid or other polyhedron 
so that it has flat triangular faces and so that it can more closely approximate a sphere 
or hemisphere. Several designs for such domes exist. As an example, consider a regular 
dodecahedron with its twelve pentagonal faces. Place a point in the middle of each 
pentagon, and connect it with five lines to the vertices of the pentagon. Raise the point 
so that it touches an imaginary sphere around the decahedron. You’ve now created a 
new polyhedron with 60 triangular faces and a simple example of a geodesic sphere. 
Closer approximations to spheres may be created by dividing the faces into more triangles. 

The triangular faces distribute stress across the entire structure, and in theory 
the domes can grow to extremely large sizes due to their rigidity and strength. The 
first true geodesic dome was designed by German engineer Walther Bauersfeld for a 
planetarium in Jena, Germany, which opened to the public in 1922. In the late 1940s, 
American architect R. Buckminster Fuller independently invented the geodesic dome, 
and he received a U.S. patent for his design. The U.S. Army was so impressed with his 
structures that they had him oversee the design of domes for military use. Aside from 
strength, domes were desirable because they enclosed a great volume for little surface 
area, which made them efficient in terms of building materials and decreased heat loss. 
Fuller himself lived in a geodesic dome for part of his life, and he noted that its low air 
resistance would help it withstand hurricanes. Always the dreamer. Fuller formulated 
the ambitious plan to place a geodesic dome, 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) in diameter and

Alexander’s Homed Sphere 

James Waddell Alexander (1888-1971) 

Alexander’s homed sphere is an example of a convoluted, intertwined surface for which 
it is visually difficult to define an inside and outside. Introduced by mathematician 
James Waddell Alexander in 1924, Alexander’s homed sphere is formed by successively 
growing pairs of horns that are almost interlocked and whose end points approach each 
other. The initial steps of the construction can be visualized with your fingers. Move 
the thumb and forefinger of each of your hands close to one another, and then grow a 
smaller thumb and forefinger on each of these, and continue this budding without limit! 
The object is a fractal, composed of interlocking pairs of "fingers” that trace orthogonal 
(perpendicular) circles of decreasing radii. 

Although difficult to visualize, Alexander’s homed sphere (together with its inside) 
is homeomorphic to a ball. (Two geometrical objects are called homeomorphic if the first 
can be deformed into the second by stretching and bending.) Thus, Alexander’s homed 
sphere can be stretched into a ball without puncturing or breaking it. Martin Gardner 
writes, “The infinitely regressing, interlocking horn forms, at the limit, what topologists 
call a 'wild structure’.... Although it is equivalent to the simply connected surface of a 
ball, it bounds a region that is not simply connected. A loop of elastic cord circling the 
base of a horn cannot be removed from the structure even in infinity of steps ” 

Alexander’s horned sphere is more than a mind-boggling curiosity—it is a concrete 
and important demonstration that the Jordan-Schonflies theorem does not extend to 
higher dimensions. This theorem states that simple closed curves separate a plane into 
an inside bounded region and an outside unbounded region and that these regions are 
homeomorphic to the inside and outside of a circle. The theorem is invalid in three 
dimensions.

Banach-Tarski Paradox 


Stefan Banach (1892-1945), Alfred Tarski (1902-1983) 

The famous and seemingly bizarre Banach-Tarski (BT) paradox was first stated by Polish 
mathematicians Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski in 1924. The paradox (which is 
actually a proof) shows how it is possible to take a mathematical representation of a ball, 
break it into several pieces, and then reassemble those pieces to make two identical 
copies of the ball. Moreover, it shows how one can decompose a pea-sized ball and then 
reassemble the pieces to make another ball the size of the moon! (In 1947, Robinson 
showed that five is the minimal number of pieces required.) 

This paradox, built on the early work of Felix Hausdorff, shows that the kinds of 
quantities that can be measured in our physical universe are not necessarily preserved 
when a ball, as defined by mathematicians, with an infinite set of points is chopped 
into pieces and reassembled in a different way using just translations and rotations. 

In the BT paradox, the unmeasurable subsets (pieces) involved are very complicated 
and convoluted, lacking straightforward counterparts to boundaries and volume in 
the physical world. The paradox does not hold in two dimensions but does hold in all 
dimensions higher than two. 

The BT paradox depends on the Axiom of Choice (AC). Because the paradox 
result seems so strange, some mathematicians have suggested that AC must be wrong. 
On the other hand, acceptance of AC is so useful in numerous branches of mathematics 
that mathematicians often quietly use it and proceed with their proofs and theorems. 

In 1939, the brilliant Banach was elected president of the Polish Mathematical 
Society, but a few years later, during the Nazi occupation, Banach was compelled to feed 
his own blood to lice for a German study of infectious diseases. Tarski had converted to 
Roman Catholicism because it would be difficult for a Jew to obtain a serious position 
in the Polish universities. During World War II, the Nazis murdered nearly all his 
extended family.

Squaring a Rectangle 

Zbigniew Moron (1904^1971) 

A difficult puzzle that has captivated mathematicians for at least a hundred years 
involves the operation of "squaring” a rectangle and a square, the latter of which is also 
known as a "perfect square dissection ” The general problem is to tile a rectangle or 
square using square tiles all of different sizes expressed as integers. This may sound easy, 
and you can even experiment with a pencil, paper, and graph paper, but it turns out 
that very few tile arrangements work. 

The first squared rectangle was discovered in 1925 by Polish mathematician 
Zbigniew Moron. In particular, Moron found a 33 x 32 rectangle that can be tiled with 
nine different squares with lengths 1,4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 18. He also discovered 
a 65 x 47 rectangle tiled with 10 square tiles with lengths 3, 5, 6 11,17,19, 22, 23, 24, 
and 25. For years, mathematicians claimed that perfect square dissections of squares 
were impossible to construct. 

In 1936, four students at Trinity College—R. L Brooks, C. A B. Smith, A. H. 

Stone, and W. T. Tutte—became fascinated by the topic, and finally, in 1940, these 
mathematicians discovered the first squared square consisting of 69 tiles! With further 
effort. Brooks reduced the number of tiles to 39. In 1962, A. W. J. Duivestijn proved 
that any squared square must contain at least 21 tiles, and in 1978, he had found such a 
square and proved that it was the only one. 

In 1993, S. J. Chapman found a tiling of the Mobius band using just 5 square tiles. A 
cylinder can also be tiled with squares of different sizes, but this requires at least 9 tiles.

Hilbert's Grand Hotel 


David Hilbert (1862-1943) 

Imagine an ordinary hotel with 500 rooms, all of which are occupied by guests. You 
arrive in the afternoon and are told that there are no vacancies. You sadly leave. There is 
no paradox here. Next, imagine a hotel in which there are an infinite number of rooms, 
each of which is occupied. Although the hotel is full, the clerk can give you a room. 
How can this be? Later on the same day, an endless stream of conventioneers arrives, 
and the clerk is able to give them all rooms, making a huge fortune in the process! 

German mathematician David Hilbert posed these paradoxes in the 1920s to 
illustrate the mysterious properties of the infinite. Here’s how you get a room in Hilbert's 
Grand Hotel. When you arrive alone at the full hotel, the clerk can give you a room 
by moving the guest who is in Room 1 into Room 2, and then moving the original 
guest in Room 2 into Room 3, and so on. Room 1 is now vacant for you. In order to 
accommodate the endless stream of conventioneers, the current occupants are all 
moved into even-numbered rooms by moving the original guest in Room 1 to Room 2, 
the original guest in Room 2 into Room 4, the original guest in Room 3 into Room 6, and 
so forth. The clerk now may assign the conventioneers to the empty odd-numbered rooms. 

The paradox of Hilbert’s Grand Hotel can be understood by using Cantor’s theory of 
Transfinite Numbers. Thus, while in an ordinary hotel, the number of odd-numbered 
rooms is smaller than the total number of rooms, in an infinite hotel, the "number” of 
odd-numbered rooms is no smaller than total “number” of rooms. (Mathematicians use 
the term cardinality when referring to the size of these sets of rooms.)

Menger Sponge 

Karl Menger (1902-1985) 


The Menger sponge is a fractal object with an infinite number of cavities—a night¬ 
marish object for any dentist to contemplate. The object was first described by Austrian 
mathematician Karl Menger in 1926. To construct the sponge, we begin with a ‘'mother 
cube” and subdivide it into 27 identical smaller cubes. Next, we remove the cube in 
the center and the six cubes that share faces with it This leaves behind 20 cubes. We 
continue to repeat the process forever. The number of cubes increases by 20", where 
n is the number of iterations performed on the mother cube. The second iteration gives 
us 400 cubes, and by the time we get to the sixth iteration, we have 64,000,000 cubes. 

Each face of the Menger sponge is called a Sierpihski carpet Fractal 
antennae based on the Sierpinski carpet are sometimes used as efficient receivers 
of electromagnetic signals. Both the carpets and the entire cube have fascinating 
geometrical properties. For example, the sponge has an infinite surface area while 
enclosing zero volume. 

According to the Institute for Figuring, with each iteration, the Sierpinski carpet 
face “dissolves into a foam whose final structure has no area whatever yet possesses a 
perimeter that is infinitely long. Like the skeleton of a beast whose flesh has vamshed, 
the concluding form is without substance—it occupies a planar surface, but no longer 
fills it.” This porous remnant hovers between a line and a plane. Whereas a line is 
one-dimensional and a plane two-dimensional, the Sierpinski carpet has a “fractional” 
dimension of 1.89. The Menger sponge has a fractional dimension (technically referred 
to as the Hausdorff Dimension) between a plane and a solid, approximately 2.73, and 
it has been used to visualize certain models of a foam-like space-time. Dr. Jeannine 
Mosely has constructed a Menger sponge model from more than 65,000 business cards 
that weighs about 150 pounds (70 kilograms).

Differential Analyzer 

Vannevax Bush (1890-1974) 


Differential equations play a crucial role in physics, engineering, chemistry, economics, 
and numerous other disciplines. These equations are relevant whenever a function 
expresses continuously changing quantities along with some rate of change, expressed 
as derivatives. Only the simplest differential equations yield solutions that are expressed 
by compact and explicit formulas with a finite number of basic functions like sines and 
Bessel Functions. 

In 1927, American engineer Vannevar Bush and his colleagues developed a 
differential analyzer (DA), an analog computer with wheel-and-disk components that 
could solve, via integration methods, differential equations with several independent 
variables. The DA was among the first advanced computing devices to be used for 
practical applications. 

Earlier versions of these kinds of devices had their roots in the work of Lord Kelvin 
and his harmonic analyzer (1876). In the United States, researchers working at the 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the 
University of Pennsylvania built the DA devices, in part for creating artillery firing tables, 
prior to the invention of ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer). 

Over the years, the DA has had many applications, ranging from soil erosion studies 
and the building of blueprints for dams to the design of bombs used to destroy German 
dams during World War II. These devices have even been featured in science fiction 
films such as the 1956 classic Earth vs. the Flying Sducersl 

In his 1945 essay “As We May Think,” Bush described his vision of the memex, 
a futuristic machine that would enhance human memory by allowing humans to 
store and retrieve information linked by associations, in a manner similar to hypertext 
on the Web today. He wrote, “It is a far cry from the abacus to the modem keyboard 
accounting machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the 
future.... Relief must be secured from laborious detailed manipulation of higher 
mathematics... .Man’s spirit should be elevated_”

Ramsey Theory 

Frank Plumpton Ramsey (1903-1930) 

Ramsey theory is concerned with finding order and patterns in systems. Author 
Paul Hoffman writes, “The idea behind Ramsey theory is that complete disorder is 
impossible.... Any mathematical ‘object’ can be found if sought in a large enough 
universe. The Ramsey theorist wants to know the smallest universe that is guaranteed 
to contain a certain object.” 

Ramsey theory is named after the English mathematician Frank Ramsey. He started 
this branch of mathematics in 1928 while exploring a problem in logic. As Hoffman 
suggested, Ramsey theorists often seek the number of elements in a system that is 
necessary for a particular property to hold. Except for some interesting work by Paul 
Erdos, it was not until the late 1950s that research in Ramsey theory began to make 
rapid progress. 

One example of the simplest application deals with the Pigeonhole Principle 
that states that if we have m pigeon homes and n pigeons, we can be sure that at least 
one home houses more than one pigeon if n> m. For a more complicated example, 
consider a scattering of n points on a paper. Each point is connected to every other 
point with a straight line that is either red or blue. Ramsey’s theorem—which is just one 
foundational result in combinatorics and Ramsey theory—shows that n must be 6 in 
order to ensure that either a blue triangle or red triangle appears on the paper. 

Another way to think about Ramsey theory involves the so-called parly problem. For 
example, what is the smallest party that is guaranteed to have either at least 3 attendees 
who are (pairwise) mutual strangers or at least 3 of them who are (pairwise) mutual 
acquaintances? The answer is 6. Determining the party size necessary to ensure the 
presence of at least 4 mutual friends or at least 4 mutual strangers is much more difficult, 
and solutions for higher party sizes may never be known.

Godel’s Theorem 


Kurt Godel (1906-1978) 


Austrian mathematician Kurt Godel was an eminent mathematician and among the 
most brilliant logicians of the twentieth century. The implications of his incompleteness 
theorem are vast, applying not only to mathematics but also touching on areas such as 
computer science, economics, and physics. When Godel was at Princeton University, 
one of his closest friends was Albert Einstein. 

Godel’s theorem, published in 1931, had quite a sobering effect upon logicians 
and philosophers because it implies that within any rigidly logical mathematical system, 
propositions or questions exist that cannot be proved or disproved on the basis of axioms 
within that system, and therefore it is possible for basic axioms of arithmetic to give rise 
to contradictions. This makes mathematics essentially “incomplete.” The repercussions 
of this fact continue to be felt and debated. Moreover, Godel's theorem put an end to 
centuries of attempting to establish axioms that would provide a rigorous basis for all 
of mathematics. 

Author Hao Wang writes on this very subject in his book Reflections on Kurt Godel: 
"The impact of Godel’s scientific ideas and philosophical speculations has been 
increasing, and the value of their potential implications may continue to increase. 

It may take hundreds of years for the appearance of more definite confirmations or 
refutations of some of his larger con]ectures.” Douglas Hofstadter notes that a second 
theorem of Godel's also suggests the inherent limitation of mathematical systems 
and “implies that the only versions of formal number theory which assert their own 
consistency are inconsistent” 

In 1970, Godel’s mathematical proof of the existence of God began to circulate 
among his colleagues. The proof was less than a page long and caused quite a stir- 
Toward the end of his life, Godel was paranoid and felt that people were hying to poison 
him. He stopped eating and died in 1978. During his life, he had also suffered from 
nervous breakdowns and hypochondria.

Champernowne’s Number 

David Gawen Champemowne (1912-2000) 

If you were to concatenate, or link together, positive integers, 1,2, 3,4,, 
and lead with a decimal point, we would obtain Champemowne’s number, 
0.1234567891011121314....Like tt, and e , Champernowne’s number is 
transcendental—that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with integer coefficients. 

We also know this number to be “normal” in base 10, which means that any finite 
pattern of numbers occurs with the frequency expected for a completely random 
sequence. David Champemowne demonstrated that this number is normal by showing 
that not only will the digits 0 through 9 occur exactly with a 10 percent frequency in the 
limit, but each possible block of two digits will occur with 1 percent frequency in the 
limit, each block of three digits will occur with 0.1 percent frequency, and so forth. 

Cryptographers have noted that Champemowne’s number does not trigger some of 
ffie simplest, traditional statistical indicators of nonrandomness. In other words, simple 
computer programs, which attempt to find regularity in sequences, may not “see" the 
regularity in Champemowne’s number. This deficit reinforces the notion that statisticians 
must be very cautious when declaring a sequence to be random or patternless. 

Champemowne's number is the first constructed example of a normal number. It 
was produced in 1933 by David Champemowne while he was still an undergraduate 
student at the University of Cambridge. In 1937, German mathematician Kurt Mahler 
proved that Champemowne’s constant is transcendental. Today, we know that the 
binary Champemowne constant, obtained by concatenating the binary (0 and 1) 
representations of the integers, is normal in base 2. 

Hans Von Baeyer suggests that by translating the 0s and Is to Morse code, “every 
conceivable finite sequence of words is buried somewhere in the string’s tedious 

gobbledygook,... every love letter and every novel ever written_You may have to travel 

out along the string for billions of light years before you find them, but they are all in 
there somewhere....”

Bourbaki: Secret Society 

Henri Cartan (b. 1904), Claude Chevalley (1909-1984), Szolem Mandelbrojt 
(1899-1983), Andre Weil (1906-1998), and others 

Historian of science Amir Aczel once wrote that Nicolas Bourbaki was “the greatest 
mathematician of the twentieth century” who “changed the way we think about 
mathematics... .He was responsible for the emergence of the 'New Math’ that 
swept through American education in the middle of the century....” His treatises 
“form a towering foundation for much of the modem mathematics.... No working 
mathematician... today is free of the influence of the seminal work of Nicolas Bourbaki.” 

However, Bourbaki, the genius mathematician and author of dozens of acclaimed 
works, never existed! Bourbaki was not an individual, but rather a secret society of 
mathematicians, almost all French, formed in 1935. The group attempted to produce 
a completely self-contained, extremely logical and rigorous treatment of all essential 
modem mathematics—from beginning to end—by publishing books on set theory, 
algebra, topology, functions, integration, and more. The founding members of the 
secret group included tire brilliant mathematicians Henri Cartan, Jean Coulomb, Jean 
Delsarte, Claude Chevalley, Jean Dieudonn6, Charles Ehresmann, Ren6 de Possel, 
Szolem Mandelbrojt, and Andr£ Weil. Members felt that older mathematicians were 
needlessly clinging to old practices; thus, members of Bourbaki had to resign by age 50. 

While writing their collaborative books, any member had the right to veto any 
aspect that he deemed inappropriate. Shouting matches ensued. At each meeting, their 
works would be read aloud and scrutinized, line by line. In 1983, Bourbaki published 
its last volume, titled Spectral Theory. Today, L’Association des Collaborateurs de Nicolas 
Bourbaki still organizes Bourbaki seminars every year. 

Author Maurice Mashaal wrote that “Bourbaki never invented revolutionary 
techniques nor proved grandiose theorems—and neither did it try to do so. What the 
group did bring... was a new vision of mathematics, a profound reorganization and 
reclarification of its components, lucid terminology and notation, and distinctive style.”

Fields Medal 


John Charles Fields (1863-1932) 

The Fields Medal is the most famous and influential award in mathematics. Like the 
Nobel Prize for other realms of achievement, the Fields Medal grew from a desire to 
elevate mathematics above national hostilities. The medal is awarded every four years 
and rewards past achievements and stimulates future research. 

The award is sometimes referred to as the “Nobel Prize of mathematicians” because 
there is no actual Nobel Prize awarded for mathematics; however, the Fields Medal is 
awarded only to mathematicians 40 years of age and younger. The monetary amount 
is relatively small, only about $13,500 in 2006 compared to the Nobel Prize, which is 
more than $1 million. The award was established by Canadian mathematician John 
Charles Fields and first awarded in 1936. When Fields died, his will specified that 
$47,000 be added to the funds for the gold medal. 

The front of the medal depicts the Greek geometer Archimedes. The Latin phrase 
on the back translates to "The mathematicians having congregated from the whole 
world awarded [this medal] because of outstanding writings.” 

Mathematician Alexander Grothendieck boycotted his own Fields Medal ceremony 
in 1966, because it was held in Moscow and he wished to protest the Soviet military 
presence in Eastern Europe. In 2006, Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman rejected 
the prize when he was awarded the medal for “his contributions to geometry and his 
revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow,” 
which led to the proof of the Poincar6 Conjecture. He refused, saying that the prize was 
irrelevant. 

Interestingly, roughly 25 percent of medalists have been Jewish, and almost half 
have held appointments at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey. 
Alfred Nobel (1833—1896), Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite, created the 
Nobel Prize; however, because he was an inventor and industrialist, he did not establish 
a prize in mathematics, because he personally had little interest in mathematics or 
theoretical sciences.

Turing Machines 

Alan Turing (1912-1954) 

Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician and computer theorist who was forced 
to become a human guinea pig and subjected to drug experiments to “reverse” his 
homosexuality. This persecution occurred despite the fact that his code-breaking work 
helped shorten World War II and led to his award of the Order of the British Empire. 

When Turing had called the police to investigate a burglary at his home in 
England, a homophobic police officer suspected that Turing was homosexual. Turing 
was forced to either go to jail for a year or take experimental drug therapy. To avoid 
imprisonment, he agreed to be injected with estrogen hormone for a year. His death at 
age 42, two years after his arrest, was a shock to his friends and family. Turing was found 
in bed. The autopsy indicated cyanide poisoning. Perhaps he had committed suicide, 
but to this day we are not certain. 

Many historians consider Turing to be the “father of modem computer science.” 

In his landmark paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the 
Entscheidungs Problem” (written in 1936), he proved that Turing machines (abstract 
symbol-manipulating devices) would be capable of performing any conceivable 
mathematical problem that is represented as an algorithm. Turing machines help 
scientists better understand the limits of computation. 

Turing is also the originator of the Turing test, which caused scientists to think more 
clearly about what it means to call a machine “intelligent” and whether machines may 
one day “think.” Turing believed that machines would eventually be able to pass his test 
by demonstrating they could converse with people in such a natural way that people 
could not tell if they were talking to a machine or a human. 

In 1939, Turing invented an electromechanical machine that could help break 
the Nazi codes produced by their Enigma code machine. Turing’s machine, called the 
"Bombe,” was enhanced by mathematician Gordon Welchman, and it became the main 
tool for deciphering Enigma communications.

Voderberg Tilings 

Heinz Voderberg (1911-1942) 

A tessellation, or tiling, of a plane consists of a collection of smaller shapes, called tiles , 
that fills a surface with no overlaps and no gaps between the tiles. Perhaps the most 
obvious tessellations are those seen on tiled floors in which the tiles are shaped like 
squares or hexagons. Hexagonal tiling is the basic structure of a honeycomb, perhaps 
“useful” to the bees because of the efficiency of this tiling in terms of material required 
to create a lattice of cells within a given area. Eight different kinds of tessellations of 
the plane exist that employ two or more convex regular polygons such that the same 
polygons, in the same order, surround each polygon vertex. 

Tessellations are common in the art of Dutch artist M. C. Escher as well as in 
ancient Islamic art. In fact, tessellations are thousands of years old and can be traced to 
the Sumerian civilization (about 4000 B.C.), in which building walls were decorated by 
tiling designs constructed from clay. 

The Voderberg tiling, discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936, is special because it 
is the earliest-known spiral tessellation of the plane. The attractive pattern is made from 
a single repeating tile in the form of an irregularly shaped nonagon—that is, a nine- 
sided polygon. As the nonagon is repeated, it forms an infinite spiral strip, which, when 
joined with another strip, covers the plane with no gaps. The Vbderberg tiling is referred 
to as monchedral because it is a tessellation in which all tiles are the same. 

In the 1970s, a wonderful new set of spiral tilings were discussed by mathematicians 
Branko Griinbaum and Geoffrey C. Shephard. Their tiles can be used to produce one-, 
two-, three-, and six- armed spirals that tile the plane. In 1980, Marjorie Rice and Doris 
Schattschneider described additional ways to create spiral tilings, containing multiple 
arms, from pentagonal tiles.

Collatz Conjecture 

Lothar Collatz (1910-1990) 

Imagine walking in a blinding hailstorm in which the hailstones drift up and down in 
the wisps and eddies of wind. Sometimes the stones shoot up for as far as your eye can 
see and then come plummeting back to Earth, smashing into the ground like little 
meteorites. 

Hailstone number problems have fascinated mathematicians for several decades 
and are studied because they are so simple to calculate yet apparently intractably hard 
to solve. To compute a sequence of hailstone numbers—also referred to as 3n + 1 
numbers—start by choosing any positive integer. If your number is even, divide it by 2. 

If it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Next, take your answer and repeat the rule. For 
example, the hailstone sequence for 3 is 3, 10, 5,16, 8,4, 2, 1,4,... (The indicates 
that the sequence continues forever as 4, 2, 1,4, 2,1,4, and so forth.) 

Like hailstones falling from the sky through storm clouds, this sequence drifts down 
and up, sometimes in seemingly haphazard patterns. Also, like hailstones, hailstone 
numbers always seem eventually to fall back down to the "ground” (the integer "1”). 

The Collatz conjecture, named after German mathematician Lothar Collatz who 
proposed it in 1937, states that this process will eventually fall to 1 for any starting 
positive integer. So far, mathematicians have not found a way to prove this conjecture, 
although the conjecture has been checked by computer for all start values up to 19 x 
2 58 - 5.48 x 10 18 . 

A variety of awards have been offered to anyone who can prove or disprove the 
conjecture. Mathematician Paul Erdos commented on the complexity of 3n + I 
numbers, "Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems.” The amiable and modest 
Collatz received many honors for his contributions to mathematics, and he died in 
1990 in Bulgaria, while attending a mathematics conference concerning computer 
arithmetic.

coloration in the complex plane. 



Ford Circles 


Lester Randolph Ford, Sr. (1886-1975) 

Imagine a frothy milkshake with an infinite number of bubbles of all sizes, touching 
one another but not interpenetrating. The bubbles become smaller and smaller, always 
filling in the cracks and spaces between larger ones. One form of such mysterious 
froth was discussed by mathematician Lester Ford in 1938, and it turns out that they 
characterize the very fabric of our "rational” number system. (.Rational numbers are 
numbers like Yi that can be expressed as fractions.) 

To create the Ford froth, begin by choosing any two integers, h and k. Draw a circle 
with radius 1/(2 it 2 -) and centered at (h/k , l/(2k 2 )). For example, if you select h = 1 and 
k = 2, you draw a circle centered at (0.5,0.125) and with radius 0.125. Continue to 
place circles for different values of h and k. As your picture becomes denser, you’ll 
notice that none of your circles intersect, although some will be tangent to one another 
(that is, just kiss one another). Any circle has an infinitude of circles that kisses it. 

Consider a godlike archer positioned above the Ford froth with an appropriately 
large y value. To simulate the shooting of the arrow, draw a vertical line from the 
location of your archer (for example, atx = a) down to the x-axis. (This line is perpend¬ 
icular to the x-axis.) If a is a rational number, the line must pierce some Ford circle 
and hit the horizontal x-axis exactly at the circle’s point of tangency. However, when 
the archers position is at an irrational number (a non-repeating, endless decimal value 
like 'tt = 3.1415...), it must leave every circle that it enters and then must enter another 
circle. Thus, the archer’s arrow must pass through an infinity of circles! A deeper 
mathematical study of Ford circles shows that they provide excellent visualizations of 
different levels of infinity and of Cantor's Transfinite Numbers.

The Rise of Randomizing Machines 

William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs (1824-1907), Six Maurice George 
Kendall (1907-1983), Bernard Babington Smith (d. 1993), Leonard Henry 
Caleb Tippett (1902-1985), Frank Yates (1902-1995), Sir Ronald Aylmer 
Fisher, FRS (1890-1962) 

In modem science, random number generators are useful in simulating natural 
phenomena and in sampling data. Before the rise of modem electronic computers, 
researchers had to be creative in their approaches for obtaining random numbers. For 
example, in 1901, Lord Kelvin used numbers written on small papers drawn from a bowl 
to generate random numbers. However, he found this approach "unsatisfactory,'’ writing, 
“The best mixing we could make in the bowl seemed to be quite insufficient to secure 
equal chances for all the billets.” 

In 1927, British statistician Leonard Tippett provided researchers with a table of 
41,600 random digits that he had constructed by taking the middle digits of numbers 
representing the area of parishes in England. In 1938, British statisticians Ronald 
Fischer and Frank Yates published 15,000 additional random numbers using two decks 
of playing cards to select digits in logarithms. 

In 1938 and 1939, British statistician Maurice Kendall started his research with 
British psychologist Bernard Babington Smith to produce random numbers by machine. 
Their randomizing machine was the first such mechanical device used to produce 
a table of 100,000 random digits. They also formulated a series of rigorous tests to 
determine if the digits were indeed statistically random. Kendall and Smith’s numbers 
were commonly used until the RAND Corporation published A Million Random Digits 
with 100,000 Normal Deviates in 1955. RAND used a roulette-wheel-like machine 
similar to the Kendall and Smith machine, and verified the digits as statistically random 
using similar mathematical tests. 

Kendall and Smith used a motor connected to a circular piece of cardboard, about 
10 inches (25 centimeters) in diameter. The disk was divided into 10 segments "as equal 
in size as we could make them,” numbered consecutively from 0 to 9. The disk was 
illuminated by a neon lamp. A capacitor charged and the lamp eventually produced a 
flash. The operator of the randomizing machine would see a number and record it

Birthday Paradox 

Richard von Mises (1883-1953) 


Martin Gardner writes, “Since the beginning of history, unusual coincidences have 
strengthened belief in the influence on life of occult forces. Events that seemed to 
miraculously violate the laws of probability were attributed to the will of gods or devils, 
God or Satan, or at the very least to mysterious laws unknown to science and mathe¬ 
matics.” One problem that has intrigued coincidence researchers is the birthday paradox. 

Imagine you are in a large living room that people gradually enter. How many 
people must be in the room before the probability that some share a birthday becomes at 
least 50 percent? This problem, posed in 1939 by Austrian-born American mathemati¬ 
cian Richard von Mises, is significant because its solution is counterintuitive to most 
people, because it is one of the most explored probability problems in classrooms today, 
and because variations of the birthday problem serve as useful models for analyzing 
amazing coincidences in everyday life. 

Assuming 365 days each year, the answer to the problem is a mere 23 people. In 
other words, if a room is filled with 23 or more randomly chosen people, there is more 
than a 50 percent probability that some pair of people will have the same birthday. For 
57 or more people, the probability is more than 99 percent The probability becomes 
100 percent if there are at least 366 people in the room, due to the Pigeonhole 
Principle. We assume that the 365 possible birthdays are equally likely, and leap days 
are ignored. The formula for calculating the probability of at least two of the n persons 
having the same birthday is 1- [365!/[365 n (365 - n)I], which can be approximated 

b yl - c -n 2 A2?65)_ 

Just 23 people may have been fewer than you expected because we were not seeking 
two particular people or a specific birth date. A match on any date for any two people 
is sufficient. In fact, 253 different pairings are possible among 23 people, any of which 
could lead to a match.

Polygon Circumscribing 

Edward Kasner (1878-1955), fames Roy Newman (1907-1966) 


Draw a circle, with a radius equal to 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters). Next, circumscribe 
(surround) the circle with an equilateral triangle. Next, circumscribe the triangle 
with another circle. Then circumscribe this second circle with a square. Continue 
with a third circle, circumscribing the square. Circumscribe this circle with a regular 
pentagon. Continue this procedure indefinitely, each time increasing the number 
of sides of the regular polygon by one. Every other shape used is a circle that grows 
continually in size as it encloses the assembly of predecessors. If you were to repeat this 
process, always adding larger circles at the rate of a circle a minute, how long would it 
take for the largest circle to have a radius equal to the radius of our solar system? 

By continually surrounding the shapes with circles, it would seem that the radii 
should grow larger and larger, becoming infinite as we continue the process. However, 
the assembly of nested polygons and circles will never grow as large as the solar system, 
never grow as large as the Earth, never grow as large as a typical adult bicycle tire. 
Although the circles initially grow very quickly in size, the rate of growth gradually 
slows down, and the radii of the resulting circles approach a limiting value given by the 
infinite product: R = 1/[cos(tt/3) x cos('It/4) x cos(tt/5)...]. 

Perhaps most intriguing was the controversy over the limiting value of R. It seems 
simple enough to compute. According to mathematicians Edward Kasner and James 
Newman, who first reported a value in the 1940s, R is approximately equal to 12. 

A value of 12 is also mentioned in a German article published in 1964. 

Christoffel J. Bouwkamp published a paper in 1965 that reports the true value 
of R = 8.7000.1 find it fascinating that, until 1965, mathematicians still assumed 
that the correct value of R was 12. The correct value of R with 17 digits is 
8.7000366252081945....

Hex 


Piet Hein (1905-1996), John Forbes Nash, Jr. (b. 1928) 

Hex is a two-player board game played on a hexagonal grid, usually in the shape of 
an 11 x 11 diamond. It was invented by Danish mathematician and poet Piet Hein 
in 1942 and independently by American mathematician John Nash in 1947. Nash, a 
Nobel Prize winner, is perhaps best known to the public as the subject of the Hollywood 
movie A Beautiful Mind, which highlights his mathematical prowess and battles with 
schizophrenia. According to the book A Beautiful Mind, Nash promoted a 14 x 14 
board as the optimal size. 

Players use differently colored pieces (for example, red and blue) and alternatively 
place them in the hexagonal cells. Red’s goal is to form a red path connecting two 
opposite sides of the board. Blue's goal is to form a path connecting the other opposite 
sides. The four corner hexagons belong to both sides. Nash discovered that the game 
can never end in a tie, and the game favors the first player, who can have a winning 
strategy. One way of making the game fairer is to allow the second player to choose his 
or her color after the first player makes the first move or after the first three moves. 

In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version of the game to the general public 
that used hexagonal playing pieces. A winning strategy for the first player has been 
demonstrated for several sizes of playing boards. Although the game seems simple, 
mathematicians have used it for more profound applications, such as for proving the 
Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem. 

Hein became internationally famous for his designs, poems, and mathematical 
games. When the Germans invaded Denmark in 1940, he was forced to go underground 
because he was the head of an anti-Nazi group. In 1944, he explained his creative 
approach: “Art is the solution to problems which cannot be formulated clearly before 
they have been solved.”

Pig Game Strategy 

John Scame (bom Orlando Carmelo Scarnecchia) (1903—1985) 

Pig is a game with simple rules but with surprisingly complex strategies and analyses. It 
is significant as a metaphor for many apparently simple problems that have led to rich 
mathematical research years later, and as a teaching tool used by numerous educators 
when discussing game strategy. 

Pig was first described in print in 1945 by John Scame—American magician, game 
expert, card manipulator, and inventor—but the game has its roots in older "folk games” 
with several variations. To play Pig, a player rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the 
player “holds” and tallies the sum of the rolls during her turn. If the player rolls a 1, 
nothing is added to the player's score during her turn, and the opponent now has his 
turn. The first player to attain a score of 100 or more wins. Example: You roll a 3. You 
decide to roll again and roll a 1. Thus, you add nothing to your score and hand the die 
to your opponent. He rolls the sequence 3-4-6 and decides to hold. Thus, he adds 13 to 
his score and hands the die back to you. 

Pig is considered a "jeopardy" dice game because players must decide if they should 
jeopardize previous gains by rolling for possible additional gains. In 2004, computer 
scientists Todd W. Neller and Clifton Presser of Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania 
analyzed Pig in detail to elucidate a strategy for optimal play. Using mathematics and 
computer graphics, they revealed an intricate, nonintuitive strategy for winning and 
showed why playing to maximize points for a single turn clearly is different from playing 
to win. About their findings and visualizations of optimal policies, they poetically write, 
"Seeing the 'landscape’ of this policy is like seeing the surface of a distant planet sharply 
for the first time, having previously seen only fuzzy images."

ENIAC 

John Mauchly (1907-1980) and J. Presper Eckert (1919-1995) 


ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was built at the 
University of Pennsylvania by American scientists John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. 
This device was the first electronic, reprogrammable, digital computer that could be 
used to solve a large range of computing problems. The original purpose of ENIAC 
was to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army; however, its first important 
application involved the design of the hydrogen bomb. 

ENIAC was unveiled in 1946, having cost nearly $500,000, and it was in nearly 
continuous use until it was turned off on October 2, 1955. The machine contained 
more than 17,000 vacuum tubes and around 5 million hand-soldered joints. An IBM 
card reader and card punch machine were used for input and output. In 1997, a team 
of engineering students led by Professor Jan Van der Spiegel created a "replica” of the 
30-ton ENIAC on a single integrated circuit! 

Other important electrical computing machines of the 1930s and 1940s include the 
American Atanasoff-Beriy Computer (demonstrated in December, 1939), the German 
Z3 (demonstrated in May, 1941), and the British Colossus computer (demonstrated in 
1943); however, these machines were either not fully electronic or not general purpose. 

The authors of the ENIAC patent (No. 3,120,606; filed in 1947) write, “With the 
advent of everyday use of elaborate calculations, speed has become paramount to such 
a high degree that there is no machine on the market today capable of satisfying the full 
demand of modem computational methods... .The present invention is intended to 
reduce to seconds such lengthy computations....” 

Today, computer use has invaded most areas of mathematics, including numerical 
analysis, number theory, and probability theory. Mathematicians, of course, increasingly 
use computers in their research and in their teaching, sometimes using computer 
graphics to gain insight. Famous mathematical proofs have been done with the aid 
of the computer.

Von Neumann’s Middle-Square 
Randomizer 


John von Neumann (1903-1957) 

Scientists use random number generators for tackling a wide variety of problems, such 
as developing secret codes, modeling the movement of atoms, and conducting accurate 
surveys. A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is an algorithm that produces a 
sequence of numbers that emulate the statistical properties of random numbers. 

The middle-square method, developed by mathematician John von Neumann in 
1946, is one of the most famous and earliest computer-based PRNGs. He started with 
a number such as 1946 and squared it to produce 3786916, which can be written as 
03 7869 16. He removed the middle four digits, 7869, and continued the process of 
squaring and removal. In actual practice, von Neumann used 10-digit numbers and 
followed the same rules. 

Von Neumann, famous for his collaborative research in thermonuclear reactions 
that led to the hydrogen bomb, understood that his simple randomizing approach 
had flaws and that the sequences would eventually repeat, but he was satisfied with 
the method for many applications. In 1951, von Neumann cautioned users of these 
schemes, “Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, 
of course, in a state of sin.” Nevertheless, he preferred this approach to better hardware- 
based random number generators that did not record their values, thus making it 
difficult to repeat procedures to identify problems. In any case, von Neumann did not 
have access to sufficient computer memory to store many “random” values. Indeed, his 
wonderfully simple approach produced numbers on the ENIAC computer hundreds of 
times faster than reading numbers from punch cards. 

More recent and useful PRNGs make use of the linear congruential method of 
the form = (aX^ + e) mod m. Here, n > 0, a is the multiplier, m the modulus, 
c the increment, and Xq the starting value. The Mersenne twister PRNG algorithm, 
developed in 1997 by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimuia, is also desirable for 
many of today's applications.

Gray Code 

Frank Gray (d. 1969), f£mile Baudot (1845-1903) 


A Gray code represents numbers in a positional notation so that when the numbers are 
in counting order, any adjacent number pair will differ in some single digit by 1, and at 
one position only. For example, 182 and 172 could be adjacent counting numbers in a 
decimal Gray code (the middle digits differ by 1), but not 182 and 162 (no digits differ 
by 1), nor 182 and 173 (more than one digit pair differs by 1). 

One simple, famous, and useful Gray code is called the reflected binary Gray code, 
which consists of only Os and Is. Martin Gardner explains that to convert a standard 
binary number to its reflected Gray equivalent, we first examine the rightmost digit and 
then consider each digit in turn. If the next digit to the left is 0, let the original digit 
stand. If the next digit to the left is 1, change the original digit. (The digit at the extreme 
left is assumed to have a 0 on its left and therefore remains unchanged.) For example, 
applying this conversion to the number 110111 gives the Gray number 101100. We can 
then convert all the standard binary numbers to create the Gray sequence that starts 0, 

1 , 11 , 10 , 110 , 111 , 101 , 100 , 1100 , 1101 , 1111 ,... 

The reflected binary code was originally designed to make it easier to prevent 
erroneous output from electromechanical switches. In this application, a slight change 
in position only affects one bit. Today, Gray codes are used to facilitate error correction 
in digital communications, such as in TV signal transmission, and to make transmission 
systems less susceptible to noise. The French engineer Emile Baudot used Gray codes 
in telegraphy in 1878. The code is named after Bell Labs research physicist Frank Gray, 
who made extensive use of these codes in his engineering patents. Gray had invented a 
method to convert analog signals to binary Gray code using vacuum tubes. Today, Gray 
codes also have important applications in graph theory and number theory.

Information Theory 

Claude Elwood Shannon (1916-2001) 

Teenagers watch TV, cruise the Internet, spin their DVDs, and chat endlessly on the 
phone usually without ever realizing that the foundations for this Information Age 
were laid by American mathematician Claude Shannon, who in 1948 published 
“A Mathematical Theory of Communication.'’ Information theory is a discipline 
of applied mathematics involving the quantification of data, and it helps scientists 
understand the capacity of various systems to store, transmit, and process information. 
Information theory is also concerned with data compression and with methods for 
reducing noise and error rates to enable as much data as possible to be reliably stored 
and communicated over a channel. The measure of information, known as information 
entropy, is usually expressed by the average number of bits needed for storage or 
communication. Much of the mathematics behind information theory was established 
by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs for the field of thermodynamics. Alan 
Turing also used similar ideas when breaking of the German Enigma ciphers during 
World War II. 

Information theory affects a diverse array of fields, ranging from mathematics and 
computer science to neurobiology, linguistics, and black holes. Information theory has 
practical applications such as breaking codes and recovering from errors due to scratches 
in movie DVDs. According to a 1953 issue of Fortune: “It may be no exaggeration to say 
that man's progress in peace, and security in war, depend more on fruitful applications 
of Information Theory than on physical demonstrations, either in bombs or in power 
plants, that Einstein’s famous equation works." 

Claude Shannon died in 2001, at the age of 84, after a long struggle with Alzheimer’s 
disease. At one point in his life, he had been an excellent juggler, unicyclist, and chess 
player. Sadly, due to his affliction, he was unable to observe the Information Age drat 
he helped create.

Curta Calculator 


Curt Herzstark (1902-1988) 

The Curta is considered by many historians of science to be the first commercially 
successful portable mechanical calculator. Developed by Austrian Jew Curt Herzstark 
while a prisoner in the Buchenwald concentration camp, the handheld Curta could 
perform multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division. The cylindrical body of the 
Curta was usually held in the left hand and contained eight sliders for number entry. 

In 1943, Herzstark was accused of “helping Jews” and “indecent contacts with 
Aryan women.” He eventually ended up at Buchenwald, where news of his technical 
expertise and ideas on calculating machines led the Nazis to demand that he make a 
drawing of his calculator designs; they had hoped to give the device to Hitler as a gift at 
the end of the war. 

After the war, in 1946, Herzstark was invited by the prince of Liechtenstein to found 
a manufacturing plant for the devices, which became widely available to the public in 
1948. For a time, the Curias were among the best portable calculators available, and 
were in frequent use until the rise of electronic calculators in the 1970s. 

The Type I Curta had an 11-digit result counter. The larger Type II Curia, introduced 
in 1954, had a 15-digit result counter. Over a period of about 20 years, approximately 
80,000 of the Curta I and 60,000 of the Curta II devices were built. 

Astronomer and author Cliff Stoll writes, “Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, and 
Lord Kelvin all complained about the time they had to waste doing simple arithmetic.... 
Oh, for a pocket calculator that could add, subtract, multiply and dividel One with 
digital readouts and memory. A simple, finger-friendly interface. But none were available 
until 1947. Then, for a quarter of a century, the finest pocket calculators came from 
Liechtenstein. In this diminutive land of Alpine scenery and tax shelters, Curt Herzstark 
built the most ingenious calculating machine ever to grace an engineer's hand: the 
Curta calculator.”

Csaszar Polyhedron 

Akos Csiszir (b. 1924) 

Polyhedra are solids built from a collection of polygons joined at their edges. How many 
polyhedra exist with every pair of vertices joined by an edge? Apart from the tetrahedron 
(triangular pyramid), the Csiszar polyhedron is the only known polyhedron that is 
considered to have no diagonals, where a diagonal is defined as a line joining any two 
vertices not connected by an edge. Note that the tetrahedron has four vertices, six edges, 
four faces, and no diagonals. An edge joins every pair of comers. 

The Cs5sz5r polyhedron was first described in 1949 by the Hungarian mathemati¬ 
cian Akos CsiszSr. Using the theory of combinatorics (the study of the ways of choosing 
and arranging objects from collections), mathematicians now know that other than the 
tetrahedron, any other no-diagonal polyhedron must have at least one hole (tunnel). 

The Csisz^r polyhedron has one hole (difficult to visualize without a model to hold) 
and is topologically equivalent to a torus (doughnut). This polyhedron has 7 vertices, 14 
feces, and 21 edges, and is the dual of the Szilassi polyhedron. For dual polyhedra, the 
vertices of one polyhedron correspond to the feces of the other polyhedron. 

David Darling writes, “It isn’t known if there are any other polyhedra in which 
every pair of vertices is joined by an edge. The next possible figure would have 12 feces, 
66 edges, 44 vertices, and 6 holes, but this seems an unlikely configuration—as, indeed, 
to an even greater extent, does any more complex member of this curious family.” 

Martin Gardner remarks on the wide-ranging applications of the Cs4sz5r poly¬ 
hedron, “In studying the skeletal structure of a bizarre solid... [we find] some remarkable 
isomorphisms that involve the seven-color map on a torus, the smallest 'finite projective 
plane/ the solution of an old puzzle about triplets of seven girls, the solution of a bridge- 
tournament problem about eight teams, and the construction of a new kind of magic 
square known as a Room square.”

Nash Equilibrium 

John Nash (b. 1928) 

American mathematician John Nash received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. 

His prize-winning work appeared almost half a century earlier in his slender 27-page 
doctoral thesis written at the age of 21. 

In game theory, the Nash equilibrium concerns games involving two or more 
players, where no player has anything to gain by changing his strategy on his own. If 
each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing his strategy 
while die other players’ strategies remain unchanged, then the current set of strategy 
choices is part of a Nash equilibrium. In 1950, Nash was the first to show in his disser¬ 
tation, “Non-cooperative Games,” that Nash equilibria for mixed strategies must exist 
for all finite games with an arbitrary number of players. 

Game theory had made great strides in the 1920s with die work of John von 
Neumann, which culminated in his book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, 
coauthored with Oskar Morgenstem. They focused on "zero-sum” games for 
which the interests of two players were stricdy opposed. Today, game theory has 
relevance in studying human conflict and bargaining and to the behavior of 
animal populations. 

As for Nash, in 1958, Fortune singled him out for his achievements in 
game theory, algebraic geometry, and nonlinear theory, calling him die most 
brilliant of the younger generation of mathematicians. He seemed destined for 
continued achievements, but in 1959, he was institutionalized and diagnosed as 
schizophrenic. He believed that aliens had made him emperor of Antarctica and 
that an ordinary thing, such as a sentence in the newspaper, could have a hidden 
and extra-important significance. Nash once remarked: "I would not dare to say 
that there is a direct relation between mathematics and madness, but there is 
no doubt that great mathematicians suffer from maniacal characteristics, delirium, and 
symptoms of schizophrenia.”

Coastline Paradox 


Lewis Fry Richardson (1881-1953), Benoit Mandelbrot (b. 1924) 

If one were to attempt to measure a coastline or the boundary of two nations, the 
value of the measurement would depend on the length of the measuring stick used. 

As the measuring stick decreased in length, the measurement would become sensitive 
to smaller and smaller wiggles in the boundary, and, in principle, the length of the 
coastline would approach infinity as the length of the stick approached zero. British 
mathematician Lewis Richardson considered this phenomenon during his attempt to 
correlate the occurrence of wars with the nature of the boundary separating two or more 
nations. (He found that the number of a country's wars was proportional to the number 
of countries it bordered.) Franco-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot built 
upon Richardson’s work and suggested that the relationship between the measuring-stick 
length (e) and the apparent total length (L) of a coastline could be expressed by the 
parameter D, the fractal dimension. 

One can appreciate D by studying the relationship between the number N of 
measuring sticks and the length e. For a smooth curve such as a circle, we have 
N(e) = c/e, where c is a constant. However, for a fractal curve like a coastline, this 
relationship becomes N(e) = c/e D . If we multiply both sides of the formula by e, the 
relation can be expressed in terms of the length of the measuring stick: L(e) = eleP. D 
corresponds somewhat to the traditional notion of dimension (a line is one dimensional, 
a plane two dimensional), except that D can be a fraction. Because a coastline is 
convoluted at different size scales, it slightly “fills” a surface, and its dimension lies 
between a line and a plane. The fractal structure implies that repeated magnification of 
its graph reveals ever-finer levels of detail. Mandelbrot gives D = 1.26 for the coastline 
of Britain. Of course, for real-world objects, we never can actually use infinitesimally 
small measuring sticks, but this "paradox” shows how natural features exhibit fractional 
dimensions over a range of measurement scales.

As one uses increasingly small measuring sticks to measure the length of the coastline of England, the length 
of the coastline appears to approach infinity. This “paradox ” shows how natural features exhibit fractional 
dimensions over a range of measurement scales. 






Prisoner’s Dilemma 


Melvin Dresher (1911-1992), Merrill Meeks Flood (b. 1908), 

Albert W. Tucker (1905-1995) 

Imagine an angel dealing with two prisoners. Both Cain and Abel are suspected of 
having illegally snuck back into the Garden of Eden = Insufficient evidence exists against 
either of them. IS neither human confesses, the angel has to lower the “charges” to 
trespassing, and the two brothers are condemned to wander the desert for a mere six 
months. If just one brother confesses, then the confessor goes free, and the other is 
doomed to crawl and eat dust for thirty years, On the other hand, if both Cain and Abel 
confess, each will get reduced sentences of five years of wandering. Cain and Abel are 
separated so that they cannot communicate. What should Cain and Abel do? 

At first, the solution to their dilemma seems straightforward: Neither Cain nor Abel 
should confess so that they both end up with the minimum punishment—wandering in 
the desert for six months. However, it's quite possible that if Cain wishes to cooperate, 
then Abel will be tempted to double-cross Cain at the last minute, thereby achieving the 
best possible outcome, which is freedom. One important game-theoretical approach 
shows that the scenario leads each suspect to confess even though it will bring a harsher 
punishment than the strategy of cooperation and no confession. Cain and Abel’s dilemma 
explores the conflict between the good of the individual and the good of the group. 

The Prisoner’s Dilemma was first formally identified in 1950 by Melvin Dresher 
and Merrill M. Flood. Albert W. Tucker researched the dilemma to understand and 
illustrate the difficulty of analyzing non-zerosum games—dilemmas in which one 
person’s victory is not necessarily the other person’s defeat. Tucker’s work has since given 
rise to an enormous related literature in disciplines ranging from philosophy and biology 
to sociology, political science, and economics.

Cellular Automata 


John von Neumann (1903-1957), Stanislaw Marcin Ulam (1909-1984), 

John Horton Conway (b. 1937) 

Cellular automata are a class of simple mathematical systems that can model a variety 
of physical processes with complex behaviors. Applications include the modeling of the 
spread of plant species, the propagation of animals such as barnacles, the oscillations of 
chemical reactions, and the spread of forest fires. 

Some of the classic cellular automata consist of a grid of cells that can exist in two 
states, occupied or unoccupied. The occupancy of one cell is determined from a simple 
mathematical analysis of the occupancy of neighbor cells. Mathematicians define the 
rules, set up the game board, and let the game play itself out on a checkerboard world. 
Though the rules governing the creation of cellular automata are simple, the patterns 
they produce are very complicated and sometimes seem almost random, like a turbulent 
fluid flow or the output of a cryptographic system. 

Early work in this area began with Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s, when he modeled 
the growth of crystals using a simple lattice. Ulam suggested that mathematician John 
von Neumann use a similar approach to modeling self-replicating systems, such as 
robots that could build other robots, and around 1952, von Neumann created the first 
2-D cellular automata, with 29 states per cell. Von Neumann proved mathematically 
that a particular pattern could make endless copies of itself within the given cellular 
universe. 

The most famous two-state, two-dimensional cellular automaton is the Game 
of Life invented by John Conway, and popularized by Martin Gardner in Scientific 
American. Despite its simple rules, an amazing diversity of behaviors and forms are 
generated including gliders—that is, arrangements of cells that move themselves 
across their universe and can even interact to perform computations. In 2002, Stephen 
Wolfram published A New Kind of Science, which reinforced the idea that cellular 
automata can have significance in virtually all disciplines of science.

Martin Gardner s 
Mathematical Recreations 



Martin Gardner (b. 1914) 

“Perhaps an angel of the Lord surveyed an endless sea of chaos , then 
troubled it gently with his finger. In this tiny and temporary swirl of 
equations, our cosmos took shape ” 

—Martin Gardner, Order and Surprise 

The authors of Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays wrote that Martin Gardner 
"brought more mathematics to more millions than anyone else ” Allyn Jackson, deputy editor 
of the American Mathematics Society, wrote that Gardner “opened the eyes of the general 
public to the beauty and fascination of mathematics and inspired many to go on to make 
the subject their life’s work.” Indeed, several famous concepts in math were first brought to 
world attention through Gardner's works before they appeared in other publications. 

Martin Gardner is an Amencan author who wrote the “Mathematical Games" column in 
Scientific American from 1957 to 1981. He has also published more than 65 books. Gardner 
attended the University of Chicago, where he earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy. 
The bulk of his vast education came through his wide reading and correspondence. 

According to many modem mathematicians, Gardner is the most important person 
to have nurtured interest in mathematics in the United States for a substantial part of the 
twentieth century. Douglas Hofstadfcer once called Gardner "one of the great intellects 
produced in this country in this century.” Gardner's "Mathematical Games” covered such 
subjects as Hexagons, Conway’s Game of Life, polyominoes, the soma cube. Hex, tangrams, 
Penrose Tries, public-key cryptography, the works of M.C. Escher,and fractals. 

Gardner's first article in Scientific American, on the topic of hexaflexagons (flexible 
folding objects), ran in December, 1956. Gerry Piel, the publisher, called Gardner into 
his office and asked him if enough similar material existed to make a regular magazine 
feature. Gardner replied that he thought so. The next issue—January, 1957—ran the 
first of the columns.

Gilbreath s Conjecture 

Norman L. Gilbreath (b. 1936) 

In 1958, after scribbling on a napkin, American mathematician and magician Norman 
L. Gilbreath presented a mystifying hypothesis concerning prime numbers. Gilbreath 
wrote the first few prime numbers—that is, numbers larger than 1, such as 5 or 13, that 
are divisible only by themselves or 1. Next, he continued to subtract successive terms 
and record the unsigned differences 

2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 31 ,... 

1 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 2 , 4 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 2 ,... 

1 , 0 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 ,... 

h 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2,... 

1 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2 ,... 

1 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2 ,... 

1 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 2 ,... 

1 , 2 , 0 , 2 ,... 

1 , 2 , 2 ,... 

1 , 0 ,... 

1 ,... 

Gilbreath’s conjecture is that, after the initial row, the first number in each row is always 
one. No one has ever found an exception, despite searches out to several hundred 
billion rows. Mathematician Richard Guy once wrote, “It does not seem likely that we 
shall see a proof of Gilbreath’s conjecture in the near future, although the conjecture is 
probably true.” Mathematicians are unsure if the conjecture is particularly relevant to 
prime numbers or whether it applies to any sequence that begins with 2 and is followed 
by odd numbers that increase at a sufficient rate with sufficient gaps between them. 

Although Gilbreath’s conjecture is historically not as significant as many of the 
other entries in this book, it is a marvelous example of the kinds of simple-to-state 
problems that even amateur mathematicians can offer, but that may require mathemati¬ 
cians centuries to solve. A proof may someday be within our grasp when humanity better 
understands the distribution of the gaps between prime numbers.

Turning a Sphere Inside Out 

Stephen Smale (b. 1930), Bernard Morin (b. 1931) 

For many years, topologists knew that it was theoretically possible to turn a sphere inside 
out (or “evert" it), yet they didn't have the slightest idea how to do it When computer 
graphics became available to researchers, mathematician and graphics expert Nelson 
Max produced an animated film finally illustrating the transformation of the sphere. 
Max's 1977 movie Turning a Sphere Inside Out was based on the 1967 sphere eversion 
work of Bernard Morin, a blind French topologist. The animation focuses on how 
the eversion can be performed by passing the surface through itself without making 
any holes or creases. Mathematicians had believed that the problem was insoluble 
until around 1958, when American mathematician Stephen Smale proved otherwise. 
However, no one could clearly visualize the motion without the graphics. 

When we discuss the eversion of a sphere, we're not talking about turning a beach 
ball inside out by pulling the deflated ball through its opening and then inflating 
it again. Instead, we are referring to a sphere with no orifice. Mathematicians try to 
visualize a sphere made out of a thin membrane that can stretch 
and even pass through itself without ripping or developing a sharp 
kink or crease. The task of avoiding such sharp creases makes the 
mathematical sphere eversion so difficult 

In the late 1990s, mathematicians went a step further and 
discovered a geometrically optimal path—one that minimizes the 
energy needed to contort the sphere through its transformation. 
This optimal sphere eversion, or optiverse, is now the star of a 
colorful computer-graphics movie titled The Optiverse. However, 
we can’t use the principles in the movie to turn a real sealed 
balloon inside out Because real balls and balloons are not made 
of a material that can pass through itself, it is not possible to turn 
such objects inside out without poking a hole through them.

Platonic Billiards 


Lewis Carroll (1832-1898), Hugo Steinhaus (1887-1972), Matthew Hudelson 
(b. 1962) 

The Platonic billiards question has intrigued mathematicians for more than a century, 
and a complete solution had to wait for nearly fifty years after it was solved for the case of 
a cube. Imagine a billiard ball bouncing around inside a cube. Friction and gravity are 
neglected for this theoretical discussion. Can we find a path such that the ball returns 
to its starting point after hitting each wall once? The problem was initially posed by 
English author and mathematician Lewis Carroll (1832-1898). 

In 1958, Polish mathematician Hugo Steinhaus widely published a solution that 
showed that such paths existed for cubes, and in 1962, mathematicians John Conway 
and Roger Hayward discovered similar paths inside a regular tetrahedron. Each leg of 
the path between walls has the same length for the cube and the tetrahedron. In theory, 
the ball bounces along die path forever. However, no one was sure if these kinds of paths 
existed for other Platonic Solids. 

Finally, in 1997, American mathematician Matthew Hudelson demonstrated 
intriguing paths for a billiard ball bouncing around inside Platonic solids—the eight¬ 
sided octahedron, 12-sided dodecahedron, and the 20-sided icosahedron. These 
Hudelson paths make contact with each side of the inner walls and finally return to 
their starting points and starting directions of travel. Hudelson used a computer to 
assist him in his research. His challenge was particularly difficult considering the 
large number of possibilities that had to be investigated for the dodecahedron and 
icosahedron. In order to obtain a better intuition about the problem for these shapes, 
Hudelson wrote a program that generated more than 100,000 random initial trajectories, 
and he studied those that hit all 12 sides in the dodecahedron and that hit all 20 sides in 
the icosahedron.

Outer Billiards 


Bernhard Hermann Neumann (1909-2002), Jurgen Moser (1928-1999), 
Richard Evan Schwartz (b. 1966) 

The concept of outer billiards (OB) was developed in the 1950s by German-bom 
British mathematician Bernhard Neumann. German American mathematician Jtirgen 
Moser popularized OB in the 1970s as a simplified model for planetary motions. To 
experiment with OB, draw a polygon. Place a point xq outside the polygon. Think of this 
as the starting point of a billiard ball. The ball moves along a straight line just touching 
a polygon vertex and continues to travel to a new point Xj such that the vertex is at the 
midpoint of the line between xq and xj. Continue the procedure with the next vertex in 
a clockwise fashion. 

Neumann asked whether such a trajectory, or orbit, around the convex polygon 
could be unbounded so that the ball eventually runs away toward infinity. For regular 
polygons, all trajectories are bounded and do not meander further and further from the 
polygon. If the vertices of tire polygons have rational coordinates (for example, they can 
be expressed in terms of fractions), the trajectories are bounded and periodic, eventually 
returning to their starting points. 

In 2007, Richard Schwartz of Brown University finally showed that Neumann's OB 
could lead to an unbounded trajectory in the Euclidean plane, demonstrating this for 
a quadrilateral called the Penrose kite, which is used in Penrose tiling. Schwartz also 
discovered three large, octagonal regions within which trajectories bounce periodically 
from one region to the other. Other regions led to behavior that converged to a set of 
points from which the trajectories are unbounded. As with other modern proofs in 
mathematics, Schwartz's initial proof relied on a computer. 

As for Neumann, he was awarded his doctorate by the University of Berlin in 1932. 
When Hitler came to power in 1933, Neumann understood the dangers of being a Jew 
and fled to Amsterdam and then to Cambridge.

polygon) may be visualized by an intricate tiling pattern The colors of various polygonal regions provide an

Newcomb's Paradox 


William A. Newcomb (1927-1999), Robert Nozick (1938-2002) 


Before you are two closed arks, or boxes, labeled “Ark 1” and "Ark 2.” An angel explains 
that Ark 1 contains a golden goblet worth $1,000. Ark 2 contains either a spider worth 
absolutely nothing or the Mona Lisa painting worth millions of dollars. You have two 
choices: Take what is in both arks, or take only what is in Ark 2. 

Now the angel makes your choice perplexing. "We have made a prediction about 
what you will decide. We are almost certainly correct When we expect you to choose 
both arks, we put only the worthless spider in Ark 2. When we expect you to take only 
Ark 2, we have placed the Mona Lisa inside it. Ark 1 always contains $1,000, no matter 
what we think you will do.” 

At first, you think that you should select only Ark 2. The angels are excellent 
predictors, and therefore you will get the Mona Lisa. If you take both arks, the angel will 
very likely have anticipated your choice and have put a spider in Ark 2. You will only 
get the $1,000 cup and a spider. 

But now the angel confuses you. “Forty days ago, we made a prediction about which 
you would choose. We already have either put the Mona Lisa or the spider in Ark 2, and 
were not going to tell you ” 

Now you think you should take both arks and get everything possible. It seems 
foolish for you to select only Ark 2, because if you do so, you can't get more than the 
Mona Lisa. Why give up the $1,000? 

This is the essence of Newcomb’s paradox, formulated in 1960 by physicist William 
A. Newcomb. The puzzle was further elucidated by philosopher Robert Nozick in 1969. 
Experts still tear their hair out over this dilemma and disagree as to your best strategy.

Sierpinski Numbers 

Wactaw Franciszek Sierpinski (1882-1969) 


Mathematician Don Zagier writes that “there is no apparent reason why one number 
is prime and another not To the contrary, upon looking at these numbers one has 
the feeling of being in the presence of one of the inexplicable secrets of creation ” In 
1960, Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski proved that there are infinitely many 
odd integers k, called Sierpinski numbers, such that k x 2 n + 1 is never prime for every 
positive integer n. Ivars Peterson writes, “That’s a strange result. There appears to be 
no obvious reason why these particular expressions never yield a prime.” Given this 
background, the Sieipifiski problem may be stated as “What is the smallest Sierpinski 
number?” 

In 1962, American mathematician John Selfiidge discovered the smallest-known 
Sierpinski number, k = 78,557. In particular, he proved that when k = 78,557, all 
numbers of the form k X 2 n + 1 are divisible by one of the following; 3, 5, 7,13,19, 
37, or 73. 

In 1967, Sierpinski and Selfiidge conjectured that 78,557 is the smallest Sierpinski 
number and, thus, is the answer to the Sierpinski problem. Today, mathematicians 
wonder if a smaller Sierpinski number will ever be discovered. If we were able to scan 
all values of k < 78,557 and find a prime number for each, then we would know for 
sure. As of February, 2008, there were a mere six candidate numbers that had not been 
eliminated as possible smaller Sierpiriski numbers. “Seventeen Or Bust,” a distributed 
computing project, is testing these remaining numbers. For example, m October 
of 2007, "Seventeen Or Bust" proved that 33,661 x 2 7>03i ’ 232 + 1, a 2,116,617-digit 
number, is prime, thus eliminating k = 33,661 as a possible Sierpinski number. If 
mathematicians are able to find a prime of the proper form for all the remaining k, the 
Sierpinski problem will be solved and the nearly 50-year quest ended.

Jacques Salomon Hadamard (1865-1963), Jules Henri Poincare (1854-1912), 
Edward Norton Lorenz (1917-2008) 

To ancient humans, chaos represented the unknown, the spirit world—menacing, 
nightmarish visions that reflected man’s fear of the uncontrollable and the need to 
give shape and structure to his apprehensions. Today, chaos theory is an exciting, 
growing field that involves the study of wide-ranging phenomena exhibiting a sensitive 
dependence on initial conditions. Although chaotic behavior often seems "random” and 
unpredictable, it often obeys strict mathematical rules derived from equations that can 
be formulated and studied. One important research tool to aid in the study of chaos is 
computer graphics. From chaotic toys with randomly blinking lights to wisps and eddies 
of cigarette smoke, chaotic behavior is generally irregular and disorderly; other examples 
include weather patterns, some neurological and cardiac activity, the stock market, and 
certain electrical networks of computers. Chaos theory has also often been applied to a 
wide range of visual art 

In science, certain famous and clear examples of chaotic physical systems exist, 
such as thermal convection in fluids, panel flutter in supersonic aircraft, oscillating 
chemical reactions, fluid dynamics, population growth, particles impacting on a 
periodically vibrating wall, various pendula and rotor motions, nonlinear electrical 
circuits, and buckled beams. 

The early roots of chaos theory started around 1900 when mathematicians such 
as Jacques Hadamard and Henri Poincar6 studied the complicated trajectories of 
moving bodies. In the early 1960s, Edward Lorenz, a research meteorologist at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, used a system of equations to model convection 
in the atmosphere. Despite the simplicity of his formulas, he quickly found one of the 
hallmarks of chaos—that is, extremely minute changes of the initial conditions led 
to unpredictable and different outcomes. In his 1963 paper, Lorenz explained that 
a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world could later affect the weather 
thousands of miles away. Today, we call this sensitivity the butterfly effect.

Ulam Spiral 

Stanislaw Maicin Ulam (1909-1984) 

In 1963, while doodling on paper during a boring meeting, Polish-bom American mathe¬ 
matician Stanislaw Ulam discovered a remarkable spiral that reveals patterns in prime 
numbers. (A prime number is a number larger than 1, such as 5 or 13, that is divisible only 
by itself or 1.) Starting with 1 at the center of the counterclockwise spiral, Ulam wrote 
consecutive natural numbers. He then circled all the prime numbers. As the spiral grew 
larger, he noticed that the prime numbers tended to form diagonal patterns. 

As later computer graphics made quite clear, although some kind of diagonal 
structures may simply arise from diagonals alternatively containing odd and even 
numbers, it is intriguing that the prime numbers tend to lie on some diagonal lines 
more than others. Perhaps more important than the discovery of patterns, Ulams simple 
demonstration highlights the use of the computer as a kind of microscope that allows 
mathematicians to visualize structures that may lead to new theorems. This kind of 
investigation in the early 1960s gradually gave rise to the explosion in experimental 
mathematics toward the end of the twentieth century. 

Martin Gardner writes, “Ulam’s spiral grids have added a touch of fantasy to 
speculations about the enigmatic blend of order and haphazardly in the distribution 
of primes.... Ulam’s doodlings in the twilight zone of mathematics are not to be taken 
lightly. It was he who made the suggestion that led him and Edward Teller to think of 
the ‘idea’ that made possible the first thermonuclear bomb.” 

In addition to his mathematical contributions and his work on the Manhattan Project 
to develop the first nuclear weapon during World War II, Ulam is also famous for his work 
on spacecraft propulsion systems. He had escaped with his brother from Poland on the 
eve of the Second World War, but the rest of his family died in the Holocaust

Continuum Hypothesis 
Undecidability 

Georg Cantor (1845-1918), Paul Joseph Cohen (1934-2007) 

In the entry on Cantor’s Transfinite Numbers, we discussed the smallest transfinite 
number called aleph-nought, written as Xq, which “counts” the number of integers. 

Even though there is an infinite number of integers, rational numbers (numbers that can 
be expressed as fractions), and irrational numbers (like the square root of 2), the infinite 
number of irrationals is in some sense greater than the infinite number of rationals and 
integers. Similarly, there are more real numbers (which include rational and irrational 
numbers) than there are integers. 

To denote this difference, mathematicians refer to the infinity of rationals or 
integers as Kq and the infinite number of irrationals or real numbers as C. There is a 
simple relationship between C and Xq, namely C = 2 K °. Here, C is the cardinality of the 
set of real numbers, which are sometimes called the continuum. 

Mathematicians also contemplate greater infinities, symbolized by Nj, X 2 , etc. 

Here, the set theory symbol X^ stands for the smallest infinite set larger than Xq, and so 
forth. Cantor’s continuum hypothesis states that C = Xj = 2 K °; however, the question 
of whether or not C truly equals Xj is considered undecidable in our present set theory. 
In other words, great mathematicians such as Kurt Godel proved that the hypothesis 
was a consistent assumption with the standard axioms of set theory. However, in 1963, 
American mathematician Paul Cohen proved that it was also consistent to assume the 
continuum hypothesis is false! Cohen was bom in Long Branch, New Jersey, into a 
Jewish family, and he graduated in 1950 from Stuyvesant High School in New York City. 

Interestingly, the number of rational numbers is the same as the number of 
integers, and the number of irrationals is fire same as the number of real numbers. 
(Mathematicians usually use the term cardinality when discussing the “number” of 
infinite numbers.)

complex plane at location p/q and have radii espial to ll(2qq). 









Superegg 

Piet Hein (1905-1996) 


Around 1965, Danish scientist, designer, and inventor Piet Hein promoted the superegg, 
also known as the super-ellipsoid, as an object of beauty and of fascination because 
it stood on either end with a spooky stability. The 3-D shape is produced by using a 
superellipse, defined by the formula \xla\ l 5 + |y/fc| 2 * = 1 for alb - 4/3, and revolving 
this shape around the x-axis. More generally, we can give the equation of the super¬ 
ellipsoid as (\x\^ a + jyj 2 ^)^ + = 1 where a and b are greater than zero. 

Hein’s supereggs, made of various materials, were popular as toys and novelty items 
in the 1960s. Today, the design is ubiquitous. Supereggs are used as candlestick holders, 
in furniture designs, and as liquid-filled stainless-steel drink coolers that are tossed into 
beverage glasses. Hein’s superegg was “laid” for the first time in 1965, when a handheld 
version was manufactured and sold by Skj0de in Skjern, Denmark. In 1971, the world’s 
largest superegg, made of metal and weighing almost a ton, was placed outside Kelvin 
Hall in Glasgow. 

French mathematician Gabriel Lam6 (1795-1870) worked with the more general 
form of the superellipse before Hein, but Hein was the first to create the superegg 
and is famous for popularizing his own versions in architecture, furniture, and even 
urban planning. 

The superellipse was also used as the shape for a roundabout road in Stockholm, 
Sweden. The ellipse was unsuitable because its pointed ends would interfere with 
smooth traffic flow in the roughly rectangular space. In 1959, Hein was asked for his 
opinion. Martin Gardner writes about the Stockholm road: “Hein’s curves proved to be 
strangely satisfying, neither too rounded nor too orthogonal, a happy blend of elliptical 
and rectangular beauty. Stockholm immediately accepted the 2.5-exponent superellipse 
[with alb - 6/5] as the basic motif of its new center_”

Fuzzy Logic 

Lotfi Zadeh (b. 1921) 

Classical two-valued logic is concerned with conditions that are either true or false. 
Fuzzy logic (FL) allows a continuous range of truth values and was introduced by 
mathematician and computer scientist Lotfi Zadeh, who grew up in Iran and moved 
to the United States in 1944. FL has a wide range of practical applications and is 
derived from fuzzy set theory, which focuses on members of a set that have degrees of 
membership. Zadeh published his groundbreaking mathematical paper on fuzzy sets in 
1965, and in 1973 provided the details of FL. 

As an example, consider a temperature-monitoring system for a device. A member¬ 
ship function may exist for the concepts cold, warm, and hot. A single measurement 
may consist of three values such as "not cold,” “slightly warm,” and "slightly hot”— 
which may be used to control the device. Zadeh believed that if feedback controllers 
could be programmed to make use of imprecise, noisy input, they could be more 
effective and easier to implement. In some sense, this approach is similar to how people 
often make decisions. 

FL methodology had a difficult start, and Zadeh could not easily find a technical 
journal to publish his 1965 paper, perhaps due to a reluctance to let “vagueness” creep 
into the engineering field. Author Kazuo Tanaka writes, “A turning point for fuzzy logic 
came in 1974 [when] Ebraham Mamdani of the University of London applied fuzzy 
logic to... the control of a simple steam engine...." In 1980, FL was used to control a 
cement kiln. Various Japanese companies have used FL to control water purification 
processes and train systems. FL has also since been used to control steel mills, self- 
focusing cameras, washing machines, fermentation processes, automobile engine 
controls, anti-lock braking systems, color-film developing systems, glass processing, 
computer programs used in financial trading, and systems used for recognizing subtle 
differences in written and spoken languages.

Fuzzy logic has been used in the design of efficient washing machines. For example, U.S patent 5,897,672, 
issued in 1999, describes the use of fuzzy logic for detecting the relative proportion of various fabric types present 
in a clothes load in a clothes washer.

Instant Insanity 

Frank Armbruster (b. 1929) 

As a child, I could never solve the colorful cube game called Instant Insanity. I shouldn’t 
have felt too bad, because 41,472 different ways exist for arranging the four cubes in a 
row, only 2 of which are solutions. A trial-and-error approach could never have worked. 

The puzzle looks deceptively simple, consisting of four cubes with one of four 
colors on each of their six feces. The goal is to arrange the four cubes in a row so that 
only one color appears along each side of the row of cubes. Because each cube has 24 
orientations, a maximum of 4l x 24 4 = 7,962,624 positions exist. However, the number 
may be reduced to 41,472 solutions, partly because the cubes can be stacked in any 
order without making a difference for the solution. 

Mathematicians have represented the colored faces of the cubes in terms of a 
graph in order to understand efficient ways of solving the puzzle. Using this approach, 
each cube is represented by a graph of the colors that appear on opposite pairs of feces. 
According to mathematics journalist Ivars Peterson, “Those familiar with graph theory 
can typically work out the solution in minutes. Indeed, the puzzle serves as a neat lesson 
in logical thinking.'’ 

The Instant Insanity craze skyrocketed after educational consultant Frank Armbruster 
licensed his version of the puzzle to Parker Brothers, and it sold more than 12 million 
copies in the late 1960s. A similar colored cube puzzle was also popular around 1900, 
when it was called the Great Tantalizer. Armbruster wrote to me, “When I was given a 
sample of the Great Tantalizer in 1965,1 saw the potential for using it to teach combin¬ 
ations and permutations. My first sample was made of wood with painted sides. I sold 
my subsequent plastic version, packaged in the solved condition, and a customer 
suggested its name, which I trademarked. Parker Brothers then made me an offer 
I couldn’t refuse.”

Langlands Program 

Robert Phelan Langlands (b.1936) 



In 1967, Robert Langlands, a 30-year-old Princeton mathematics professor, wrote a letter 
to the famous number theorist Andre Weil (1906-1998), asking Weil’s opinion on some 
new mathematical ideas. “If you are willing to read [my letter] as pure speculation, I 
would appreciate that If not—I'm sure you have a waste basket." According to Science 
writer Dana Mackenzie, Weil never wrote back, hut Langlands’ letter turned out to be a 
“Rosetta stone” linking two different branches of mathematics. In particular, Langlands 
posited that an equivalence existed between Galois representations (which describe 
relationships among solutions to equations studied in number theory) and automorphic 
forms (highly symmetric functions like the cosine function). 

The Langlands program is so fertile a territory that it led to two Fields Medals for 
other mathematicians. Langlands’ conjectures sprang, in part, from an effort to find 
general versions of patterns that govern how whole numbers can be broken down into 
sums of products of other whole numbers. 

According to The Fermat Diary, the Langlands program may be considered a 
grand unified theory of mathematics that suggests that “the mathematics of algebra, 
which involves equations, and the mathematics of analytics, which involves the study 
of smooth curves and continuous variations, are intimately related.” The conjectures in 
the Langlands program "are like a cathedral, the way they fit together so beautifully.” 
However, the conjectures are very difficult to prove, and some mathematicians feel that 
it may take centuries to complete the Langlands program. 

Mathematician Stephen Gelbart writes, “[The] Langlands program is a synthesis of 
several important themes in classical number theory. It is also—and more significantly—a 
program for future research. This program emerged around 1967 in the form of a series of 
conjectures, and it has subsequently influenced research in number theory m much the 
same way the conjectures of A. Weil shaped the course of algebraic geometry since 1948.”

Sprouts 

John Horton Conway (b. 1937) and Michael S. Paterson (b. 1942) 

The game of Sprouts was invented in 1967 by mathematicians John H. Conway and 
Michael S. Paterson, when both were at the University of Cambridge. The addictive 
game has fascinating mathematical properties. Conway wrote to Martin Gardner, 

“The day after Sprouts sprouted, it seemed that everyone was playing it.. .peering over 
ridiculous to fantastic Sprout positions. Some people were already attacking Sprouts on 
toruses, Klein bottles, and... thinking of higher-dimensional versions." 

To play Sprouts against an opponent, start by placing several dots on a page. To 
make a move, draw a curve between two spots or a loop from a spot to itself. Your curve 
may not cross another curve or itself. Next, place a new dot on this curve. Players take 
turns, and the player who makes the last move wins. Each dot can have at most three 
curves connected to it. 

After just a casual inspection, one might guess that a game could keep sprouting 
forever. However, we now know that when Sprouts starts with n spots, the game will last 
at least 2n moves and at most 3n — 1 moves. The first player can always win in games 
that start with three, four, or five dots. 

In 2007, researchers used computer programs to help determine which player is the 
winner for all games with up to 32 spots. The status of the 33-spot game is still unknown. 
Sprouts experts Julien Lemoine and Simon Viennot write, "Despite the little number of 
moves... it is difficult to determine whether the first or the second player wins, provided 
those players play perfectly. The best published and complete hand-checked proof is 
due to [Riccardo] Focardi and [Flaminia] Luccio, and shows who the winner is for the 
7-spot game." Journalist Ivars Peterson writes, “Games can sprout all sorts of unexpected 
growth patterns, making formulation of a winning strategy a tricky proposition. No one 
has yet worked out a complete strategy for perfect play."

Despite its apparent simplicity, the game is very difficult to analyze as the number of starting points modestly 
increases.

Catastrophe Theory 

Ren6 Thom (1923-2002) 

Catastrophe theory is the mathematical theory of dramatic or abrupt changes. Mathe¬ 
maticians Tim Poston and Ian Stewart give examples: “the roar of an earthquake [or] the 
critical population density below which certain creatures grow up as grasshoppers, above 
which as [swarming] locusts... .A cell suddenly changes its reproductive rhythm and 
doubles and redoubles, cancerously. A man has a vision on the road to Tarsus.” 

Catastrophe theory was developed by French mathematician Rene Thom in the 
1960s. The theory was further promoted in the 1970s by Japanese-bom British mathema¬ 
tician Christopher Zeeman, who continued to apply the theory to the behavioral and 
biological sciences. Thom was awarded the Fields Medal in 1958 for his work in 
topology, the study of geometrical shapes and their relationships. 

Catastrophe theory usually concerns dynamical systems that describe the time 
dependence of some quantity (like the beating of the heart) and the relationship of 
these systems to topology. In particular, the theory focuses on certain kinds of “critical 
points” in which the first derivative of a function, and one or more higher derivatives, 
are zero. David Darling writes: "Many mathematicians took up the study of catastrophe 
theory, and it was in tremendous vogue for a while, yet it never achieved the success that 
its younger cousin chaos theory has because it foiled to live up to its promise of useful 
predictions.” 

Thom’s quest was to better understand how continuous actions (such as smooth 
and stable behavior in prisons or between countries) could suddenly give way to 
discontinuous change (prison riots or war). He showed how such phenomena might be 
described with their own landscapes in the form of abstract mathematical surfaces, with 
names like the butterfly or the swallowtail. Salvador Dalfs last painting, The Swallow’s 
Tail (1983), was based on a catastrophe surface. Dali also painted Topological Abduction 
of Europe: Homage to Ren6 Thom (1983), which depicted a fractured landscape along 
with the equation that explained it

Catastrophe theory is the mathematical theory of abrupt changes, such as the swarming behavior of grasshoppers 
as population density increases Research has suggested that the sudden swarming behavior is triggered by 
increased contacts of the insect's hind legs over a few-hour period Large swarms may consist of billions of insects 






Tokarsky’s Unilluminable Room 

George Tokarsky (b. 1946) 

Imagine that we are in a dark room with flat walls covered with mirrors. The room has 
several turns and side passages. If I light a match somewhere in the room, would you 
be able to see it no matter where you stand in the room, and no matter what the room 
shape or in which side passage you stand? We can equivalently pose the question in 
terms of a billiard ball bouncing around a pool table. Must there be a pool shot between 
any two points on a polygonal pool table? 

If we happened to be trapped in an L-shaped room, you'd be able to see the flame 
no matter where we stood because the light ray could bounce off various walls to get to 
your eye. But can we imagine a mysterious polygonal room that is so complicated that a 
point exists that light never reaches? (For our problem, we consider a person and match 
to be transparent.) 

This enigma was first presented in print by mathematician Victor Klee in 1969, 
although it dates back to the 1950s when mathematician Ernst Straus pondered such 
problems. It is shocking that no one knew the answer until 1995, when George Tokarsky 
of the University of Alberta discovered such a room that is not completely illuminable. 
His published floor plan of the room had 26 sides. Subsequently, Tokarsky found an 
example with 24 sides, and this strange room is the least-sided unilluminable polygonal 
room currently known. We do not know if an unilluminable polygonal room with fewer 
sides is possible. 

Other similar problems exist In 1958, mathematical physicist Roger Penrose and 
his colleague showed that unlit regions can exist in certain rooms with curved sides. 
More recently, certain curved rooms have been discovered for which infinitely many 
matches are needed to illuminate every point. For any finite number of matches, curved 
rooms exist that cannot be illuminated by these matches. 

SEE ALSO Projective Geometry (1639) and Art Gallery Theorem (1973). 


In 1995, mathematician George Tokarsky discovered this unilluminable 26-sided polygonal “room.” The room 
contains a location at which a match can be held that leaves another point in the room in the dark. 


























Donald Knuth and Mastermind 


Donald Ervin Knuth (b. 1938), Mordecai Meirowitz 

Mastermind is a code-breaking board game invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, 
an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert Mainstream game companies all 
rejected Meirowitz; thus, he published with the small English game company Invicta 
Plastics. The game went on to sell more than 50 million copies, making it the most 
successful new game of the 1970s. 

To play the game, a code-maker selects a sequence of four colors, represented by 
colored pegs that come in 6 different colors. The opponent must guess the code-maker s 
secret sequence, with as few guesses as possible. Each guess is presented in the form 
of a sequence of 4 colored pegs. The code-maker reveals how many of those pegs are 
both the correct color and in the correct position and how many more are the correct 
color but in the wrong position. For example, the secret code may be green-white-blue- 
red. The guess may be orange-yellow-blue-white. Here, the code-maker indicates that the 
player has 1 peg of the correct color in the correct position and 1 peg of the correct color 
in the wrong position, but he doesn’t mention the specific color names. The game 
continues with more guesses. A code-maker selects from a possible 6 4 (or 1,206) possible 
combinations, assuming there are 6 colors and 4 positions. 

Mastermind was significant, partly due to the long stream of research the game 
triggered. In 1977, American computer scientist Donald Knuth published a strategy that 
enables a player to always guess the correct code within 5 guesses. This was the first- 
known algorithm to solve Mastermind, and numerous papers followed. In 1993, Kenji 
Koyama and Tony W. Lai published a strategy with a maximum of 6 guesses required in 
the worst case, but with an average number of guesses of only 4.340. In 1996, Zhixiang 
Chen and colleagues generalized previous results to the case of n colors and m positions. 
The game has also been studied several times using genetic algorithms, techniques 
inspired by evolutionary biology.

Erdos and Extreme Collaboration 


Paul Erdos(1913-1996) 


The public often thinks of mathematicians as being sequestered in private rooms, 
rarely talking to others as they work for days to generate new theorems and solve 
ancient conjectures. This is true for some, but Hungarian-born Paul Erdos showed 
mathematicians the value of collaborations and "social mathematics.” By the time he 
died, he had published roughly 1,500 papers—more papers than any mathematician in 
the history of the world, having worked with 511 different collaborators. His work ranged 
through a vast landscape of mathematics, including probability theory, combinatorics, 
number theory, graph theory, classical analysis, approximation theory, and set theory. 

During the last year of his life, at age 83, he continued churning out theorems 
and delivering lectures, defying conventional wisdom that mathematics was a young 
person s sport Through all his work, he always shared ideas, caring more that a problem 
was solved than who solved it. Author Paul Hoffman wrote, "Erdos thought about more 
problems than any other mathematician in history and could recite the details of some 
1,500 papers he had written. Fortified by coffee, Erdos did mathematics 19 hours a day, 
and when friends urged him to slow down, he always had the same response: 'There'll 
be plenty of time to rest in the grave.’” After 1971, he took amphetamines almost every 
day to escape depression and foster mathematical ideas and collaborations. Erdos 
traveled constantly and lived out of a plastic bag, focusing totally on mathematics at the 
expense of companionship, sex, and food. 

Erdos made an early mark on mathematics at the age of 18, when he discovered 
an elegant proof of the theorem that, for each integer n greater than 1, there is always a 
prime number between n and double the number, 2 n. For example, the prime number 
3 lies between 2 and 4. Erdos later formulated an elementary proof of the Prime 
Number Theorem, which describes the distribution of prime numbers.

HP-35: First Scientific Pocket 
Calculator 


William Redington Hewlett (1913-2001) and team 

In 1972, the Hewlett-Packard (HP) company, with headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 
introduced the worlds first scientific pocket calculator—that is, a handheld calculator 
with trigonometric and exponential functions. The large numeric range of the HP-35 
calculator, with its scientific notation, was from 10 -100 to 10 +10 °. The HP-35 was introduced 
at a selling price of US $395. (HP called the device the “35” because it had 35 keys.) 

Company co-founder Bill Hewlett began to develop the compact calculator despite 
market studies that suggested almost no market existed for pocket-size calculators. 

How wrong they were! In the first few months of sales, orders exceeded the company’s 
expectations with respect to the entire market size. In the first year, 100,000 HP-35s were 
sold, and more than 300,000 were sold by the time it was discontinued in 1975. 

When the HP-35 was introduced, slide rules were available for performing high- 
end scientific calculations. Existing pocket calculators at the time performed addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HP-3 5 changed everything. The slide 
rule—which was typically accurate to only three significant figures—“died” and was 
rarely taught again in many U.S. schools. One wonders what the great mathematicians 
of yore would have accomplished if they had had access to an HP-35 (along with an 
endless supply of batteries). 

Today, scientific calculators are inexpensive and have significantly changed the 
mathematics curriculum taught in most countries. Educators no longer teach paper- 
and-pencil methods for computing values of transcendental functions. In the future, 
teachers will probably devote even more time to mathematical applications and concepts 
instead of routine computations. 

Author Bob Lewis writes, “Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded Silicon Valley 
in Hewlett's garage. A coin toss made the company Hewlett-Packard instead of Packard 
Hewlett... Hewlett never showed much interest in being a celebrity. Throughout his 
life, he remained, at heart, an engineer.”

The HP-35 calculator was the world’s first scientific pocket calculator, with trigonometric and exponential 
functions Bill Hewlett begpn to develop the compact calculator despite erroneous market studies that suggested 
almost no market existed for pocket-size calculators.

Penrose Tiles 


Roger Penrose (b. 1931) 

Penrose tiles refers to two simple geometric shapes that, when put side by side, can 
cover a plane in a pattern with no gaps or overlaps and that do not repeat periodically. 
In contrast, the simple hexagonal tile patterns found on some bathroom floors exhibit 
a simple repeating pattern. Interestingly, Penrose tilings, named after English mathe¬ 
matical physicist Roger Penrose, have five-fold rotational symmetry, the same kind 
of symmetry exhibited by a five-pointed star. If you rotate the entire tile pattern by 
72 degrees, it looks the same as the original. Author Martin Gardner writes, “Although it 
is possible to construct Penrose patterns with a high degree of symmetry... most patterns, 
like the universe, are a mystifying mixture of order and unexpected deviations from 
order. As the patterns expand, they seem to be always striving to repeat themselves but 
never quite managing it.” 

Before Penrose’s discovery, most scientists believed that crystals based on five-fold 
symmetry would be impossible to construct, but quasicrystals resembling Penrose tile 
patterns have since been discovered, and they have remarkable properties. For example, 
metal quasicrystals are poor conductors of heat, and quasicrystals can be used as slippery 
nonstick coatings. 

In the early 1980s, scientists had speculated about the possibility that the atomic 
structure of some crystals might be based on a nonperiodic lattice—that is, a lattice 
that does not have periodic repeats. In 1982, Dan Shechtman discovered a nonperiodic 
structure in the electron micrographs of an aluminum-manganese alloy with an obvious 
five-fold symmetry reminiscent of a Penrose tiling. At the time, this finding was so 
startling that some said it was as shocking as finding a five-sided snowflake. 

As an interesting aside, in 1997 Penrose filed a copyright lawsuit against a company 
that had allegedly embossed Penrose tilings on Kleenex quilted toilet paper in England. 
In 2007, researchers published evidence in Science of a Penrose-like tiling in medieval 
Islamic art, five centuries before its discovery in the West.

Art Gallery Theorem 

Vaclav (VaSek) Chvdtal (b. 1946), Victor Klee (b. 1925) 

Imagine that you are in an expensive art gallery room represented by a polygon. If we 
were to place guards at some of the comers (vertices) of the room, what is hie minimum 
number of guards needed so that the entire interior of a polygon can be viewed simul¬ 
taneously? Assume that the guards can see in all directions at once, but they can't see 
through walls. Also, the guards are placed in the comers of the gallery so they don’t 
block anyone’s view of the art. The problem can be initially explored by drawing poly¬ 
gonal rooms and shading the line of sight for guards placed at several vertices. 

ChvStal s art gallery theorem, named after Czechoslovakian-bom mathematician 
and computer scientist Vaclav Chvdtal, states that in an art gallery with n comers, there 
needs to be at most |_n/3j guards at the comers to watch the entire gallery, where the |_ J 
symbols indicate the mathematical floor function that returns the largest integer less 
than or equal to n/3. We assume that the polygon is "simple,” which means that the art 
gallery walls don’t self-intersect and that they only meet at their end points. 

In 1973, mathematician Victor Klee posed the question about the required number of 
guards to Chv&tal, and Chvital proved it shortly thereafter. Interestingly, only [_n/4J guards 
are needed to watch a polygonal art gallery having comers that are all right angles. Thus, 
for this kind of gallery with 10 comers, only 2 rather than 3 guards are needed. 

Researchers have since considered the art gallery problem using 
guards who can move along straight lines rather than remain in fixed 
positions. The problem has also been contemplated in three dimensions 
and with walls with holes. Norman Do writes, “When Victor Klee first 
posed the art gallery problem, he probably had little idea that it would 
motivate such a wealth of research which still continues over thirty 
years later. The area is [now] absolutely brimming with interesting 
problems....”

Rubik s Cube 


Emo Rubik (b. 1944) 


Rubiks Cube was invented by the Hungarian inventor Emo Rubik in 1974, patented 
in 1975, and placed on the Hungarian market in 1977. By 1982, as many as 10 million 
cubes had been sold in Hungary, more than the population of the country. It is 
estimated that more than 100 million have been sold worldwide. 

The cube is a 3 x 3 x 3 array of smaller cubes that are colored in such a way that 
the six faces of the large cube have six distinct colors. The 26 external sub-cubes are 
internally hinged so that these six feces can be rotated. The goal of the puzzle is to 
return a scrambled cube to a state in which each side has a single color. There are 

43,252,003,274,489,856,000 



different arrangements of tire small cubes, and only one of these arrangements is the 
initial position where all colors match on each of the six sides. If you had a cube for 
every one of these “legal” positions, then you could cover the entire surface of the earth 
(including oceans) about 250 times. A column consisting of all the cube positions would 
stretch about 250 light years. There are 1.0109 x 10 38 combinations of the 3x3x3 
Rubik’s Cube if you are allowed to remove the colored stickers and place them on 
different sub-cube feces. 

The minimum number of turns required to solve the puzzle for an arbitrary starting 
position is still not known. In 2008, Tomas Rokicki proved that all positions of Rubik’s 
cube can be solved in 22 or fewer cube face turns. 

One natural variation that never appeared on toy store shelves is the four¬ 
dimensional version of Rubik’s Cube—Rubik’s tesseract. The total number of 
positions of Rubik's tesseract is 1.76 x 10^. If either the cube or the tesseract 
changed positions every second since tire beginning of the universe, they would 
still be turning today and not have exhibited every possible configuration.

Chaitin’s Omega 

Gregory John Chaitin (b. 1947) 

A computer program is said to “halt” when it accomplishes its task—for example, when 
it has computed the thousandth prime number or the first hundred digits of pi. On the 
other hand, a program will run forever if the task is unending, such as computing every 
Fibonacci number. 

What happens if we feed a random sequence of bits to a Turing Machine for its 
program? (A Turing machine is an abstract symbol-manipulating device that can 
simulate the logic of a computer.) When this program is started, what is the probability 
that the machine will halt? The answer is Chaitin’s number ft (omega). The number 
varies depending on the machine, but for a given machine, ft is a well-defined irrational 
number with a value between zero and one. For most computers, ft is close to a value 
of 1 because a completely random program is likely to instruct a computer to do 
something impossible. Argentine-American mathematician Gregory Chaitin has shown 
that the digit sequence of ft is patternless, that ft is definable but utterly incalculable, 
and that it has infinitely many digits. The features of ft have vast mathematical 
implications and place fundamental limits on what we can know. 

Quantum theorist Charles Bennett writes, “The most remarkable property of ft... 
is the feet that if the first few thousand digits of ft were known, they would, at least in 
principle, suffice to decide most of the interesting open questions in mathematics....” 
David Darling says that the properties of ft show that solvable problems “form a tiny 
archipelago in a vast ocean of undecidability.” According to Marcus Chown, ft “reveals 
that mathematics.. .is mostly made of gaping holes. Anarchy.. .is at the heart of the 
universe.” 

Time magazine explains, "The concept broadens.. .Godels incompleteness 
theorem, which says there will always be unprovable statements in any system of 
math, and Turing’s halting problem, which says it’s impossible to predict... whether a 
particular computer calculation can ever be finished.”

Surreal Numbers 


John Horton Conway (b. 1937) 

Surreal numbers are a superset of the real numbers, invented by prolific mathematician 
John Conway for the analysis of games, although the name was coined by Donald 
Knuth in his popular 1974 novelette Surreal Numbers, perhaps one of the few times that 
a major mathematical discovery was published first in a work of fiction. Surreal numbers 
have numerous bizarre properties. As background, real numbers include both rational 
numbers, such as V 2 , and irrational numbers, such as pi, and they may be visualized as 
points on an infinitely long number line. 

Surreal numbers include the real numbers plus much more. Martin Gardner writes 
in Mathematical Magic Show, “Surreal numbers are an astonishing feat of legerdemain. 
An empty hat rests on a table made of a few axioms of standard set theory. Conway 
waves two simple mles in the air, then reaches into almost nothing and pulls out an 
infinitely rich tapestry of numbers that form a real and closed field. Every real number is 
surrounded by a host of new numbers that lie closer to it than any other 'real’ value does. 
The system is truly ‘surreal.’ ” 

A surreal number is a pair of sets {X^, Xr] where the indices indicate 
the relative position (left and right) of the sets in the pair. Surreal numbers 
are fascinating because they are built upon an extremely small and simple 
foundation. In feet, according to Conway and Knuth, surreal numbers follow 
two mles: 1) Every number corresponds to two sets of previously created 
numbers, such that no member of the left set is greater than or equal to any 
member of the right set, and 2) one number is less than or equal to another 
number if and only if no member of the first number's left set is greater than 
or equal to the second number, and no member of the second number's right 
set is less than or equal to the first number. 

Surreal numbers include infinity and infinitesimals, numbers smaller than any 
imaginable real numbers.

Perko Knots 


Kenneth A Perko, Jr. (1941-2002), Wolfgang Haken (b. 1928) 


For centuries, mathematicians have searched for ways to distinguish knots. As just one 
example, the two configurations shown here represent two knots that for more than 
75 years were thought to represent two distinct knot types. In 1974, mathematicians 
discovered that it was possible to simply change the point of view of one knot to 
demonstrate that both knots were the same. Today, we call these Perko pair knots after 
the New York lawyer and part-time topologist Kenneth Perko, who showed that they 
were in fact the same knot, while he manipulated loops of rope on his living room floor! 

Two knots are considered to be the same if we can manipulate one of them without 
cutting it so that it looks exactly like the other one with respect to the locations of the 
over- and under-crossings. Knots are classified by, among other characteristics, the 
arrangement and number of their crossings and certain characteristics of their mirror 
images. Stated more precisely, knots are classified using a variety of invariants, of which 
their symmetries are one and their crossing number is another, and characteristics of the 
mirror image play an indirect role in the classification. No general, practical algorithm 
exists to determine if a tangled curve is a knot or if two given knots are interlocked. 
Obviously, simply looking at a knot projected onto a plane—while keeping the under¬ 
and over-crossing apparent—is not an easy way to tell if a loop is a knot or an unknot. 
(The unknot is equivalent to a closed loop like a simple circle that has no crossings.) 

In 1961, mathematician Wolfgang Haken devised an algorithm to determine if a 
knot projection on a plane (while preserving the under- and over-crossings) is actually an 
unknot. However, the procedure is so complicated that it has never been implemented. 
The paper describing the algorithm in the journal Acta Mathematica is 130 pages long.

Fractals 


Benoit B. Mandelbrot (b. 1924) 

Today, computer-generated fractal patterns are everywhere. From squiggly designs on 
computer art posters to illustrations in the most serious of physics journals, interest 
continues to grow among scientists and, rather surprisingly, artists and designers. The 
word fractal was coined in 1975 by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot to describe an 
intricate-looking set of curves, many of which were never seen before the advent of 
computers with their ability to quickly perform massive calculations. Fractals often 
exhibit self-similarity, which suggests that various exact or inexact copies of an object 
can be found in the original object at smaller size scales. The detail continues for many 
magnifications—like an endless nesting of Russian dolls within dolls. Some of these 
shapes exist only in abstract geometric space, but others can be used as models for 
complex natural objects such as coastlines and blood vessel branching. The dazzling 
computer-generated images can be intoxicating, motivating students’ interest in math 
more than any other mathematical discovery in the last century. 

Physicists are interested in fractals because they can sometimes describe the chaotic 
behavior of real-world phenomena such as planetary motion, fluid flow, the diffusion of 
drugs, the behavior of inteT-industry relationships, and the vibration of airplane wings. 
(Chaotic behavior often produces fractal patterns.) Traditionally, when physicists or 
mathematicians saw complicated results, they often looked for complicated causes. 

In contrast, many fractal shapes reveal the fantastically complicated behavior of the 
simplest formulas. 

Early explorers of fractal objects include Karl Weierstrass, who in 1872 considered 
functions that were everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable, and Helge von 
Koch, who in 1904 discussed geometric shapes such as the Koch Snowflake. In the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several mathematicians explored fractals in 
the complex plane; however, they could not fully appreciate or visualize these objects 
without the aid of the computer.

Feigenbaum Constant 

Mitchell Jay Feigenbaum (b. 1944) 

Simple formulas can produce amazingly diverse and chaotic behaviors while character¬ 
izing phenomena ranging from the rise and fell of animal populations to the behavior 
of certain electronic circuits. One formula of special interest is the logistic map, which 
models population growth and was popularized by biologist Robert May in 1976 
and based on the earlier work of Belgian mathematician Pierre Francois Verhulst 
(1804-1849), who researched models of population changes. The formula may be 
written as x^] = rx n (l - x^). Here, x represents the population at time n. The variable 
x is defined relative to the maximum population size of the ecosystem and therefore 
has values between 0 and 1. Depending on the value of r, which controls the rate of 
growth and starvation, the population may undergo many behaviors. For example, as r is 
increased, the population may converge to a single value, or bifurcate so that it oscillates 
between two values, then oscillates between four values, then eight values, and finally 
becomes chaotic such that slight changes in the initial population yield very different, 
unpredictable outcomes. 

The ratio of the distances between two successive bifurcation intervals approaches 
the Feigenbaum constant, 4.6692016091..., a number discovered by American mathe¬ 
matical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum in 1975. Interestingly, although Feigenbaum 
initially considered this constant for a map similar to the logistic map, he also showed 
that it applied to all one-dimensional maps of this kind. This means that multitudes 
of chaotic systems will bifurcate at the same rate, and thus his constant can be used to 
predict when chaos will be exhibited in systems. This kind of bifurcation behavior has 
been discovered in many physical systems before they enter the chaotic regime. 

Feigenbaum quickly realized that his “universal constant” was important, remarking 
that “I called my parents that evening and told them that I had discovered something 
truly remarkable, that, when I had understood it, would make me a famous man.”

Public-Key Cryptography 

Ronald Lorin Rivest (b. 1947), Adi Shamir (b. 1952), Leonard Max Adleman 
(b. 1945), Bailey Whitfield Diffie (b. 1944), Martin Edward Heilman 
(b. 1945), Ralph C. Merkle (b. 1952) 

Throughout history, cryptologists have sought to invent a means for sending secret 
messages without the use of cumbersome code books that contained encryption and 
decryption keys that could easily fall into enemy hands. For example, the Germans, 
between 1914 and 1918, lost four code books that were recovered by British intelligence 
services. The British code-breaking unit, known as Room Forty, deciphered German 
communications, giving Allied forces a crucial strategic advantage in World War I. 

In order to solve the key management problem, in 1976, Whitfield Diffie, Martin 
Heilman, and Ralph Merkle at Stanford University, California, worked on public-key 
cryptography, a mathematical method for distributing coded messages through the use 
of a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The private key is kept 
secret, while, remarkably, the public key may be widely distributed without any loss of 
security. The keys are related mathematically, but the private key cannot be derived 
from the public key by any practical means. A message encrypted with the public key 
can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key. 

To better understand public-key encryption, imagine a mail slot in the front door 
to a home. Anyone on the street can stuff something into the mail slot; the public key is 
akin to the house address. However, only the person who possesses the key to the house 
door can retrieve the mail and read it 

In 1977, MIT scientists Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman suggested 
that large prime numbers could be used to guard the messages. Multiplication of two 
large prime numbers is easy for a computer, but the reverse process of finding the two 
original prime numbers given their product can be very difficult It should be noted that 
computer scientists had also developed public-key encryption for the British intelligence 
at an earlier date; however, this work was kept secret for reasons of national security.

Szilassi Polyhedron 

Lajos Szilassi (b. 1942) 

Polyhedra are three-dimensional solids with flat faces and straight edges. Common 
examples include the cube and regular tetrahedron, which is a pyramid that is com¬ 
posed of four feces in the shape of equilateral triangles. If the polyhedron is regular, 
each face has the same size and shape. 

The Szilassi polyhedron was discovered in 1977 by Hungarian mathematician Lajos 
Szilassi. This polyhedron is a heptahedron (seven-sided polygon) with seven 6-sided 
faces, 14 vertexes, 21 edges, and a hole. If we were to smooth the surface of the Szilassi 
polyhedron to make the edges less apparent, we could see that, from a topological stand¬ 
point, the Szilassi polyhedron is equivalent to a doughnut (or torus). The polyhedron has 
an axis of 180-degree symmetry. Three pairs of feces are congruent—that is, they have 
the same shape and size. The other unpaired face is a symmetrical hexagon. 

Remarkably, the tetrahedron and the Szilassi polyhedron are the only two known 
polyhedra in which each face shares an edge with each other face. Gardner writes 
that "until Szilassi's computer program found the structure, it was not known that it 
could exist.” 

The Szilassi polyhedron also provides insight into the problem of coloring maps. A 
traditional map may be colored with a minimum of four colors so that no two adjacent 
regions are the same color. For a map on the surface of a torus, the number is seven. This 
means that each face of the Szilassi polyhedron must be a different color to ensure that 
no two adjacent feces have the same color. For comparison, a tetrahedron demonstrates 
that four colors are necessary for a map on a surface that is topologically equivalent to a 
sphere. The properties of the two polyhedra may be summarized like this: 

Tetrahedron 4 faces 4 vertices 6 edges 0 holes 

Szilassi polyhedron 7 faces 14 vertices 21 edges 1 hole

Ikeda Attractor 


Kensuke S. Ikeda (b. 1949) 

A deep reservoir for striking images is the dynamical system. Dynamical systems are 
models comprising the rules that describe the way some quantity undergoes a change 
through time. For example, the motion of planets about the sun can be modeled as a 
dynamical system in which the planets move according to Newton's Laws. The figure 
shown here represents the behavior of mathematical expressions called differential 
equations. One way of understanding the behavior of differential equations involves 
us imagining a machine that takes in values for variables at an initial time and then 
generates the new values at some later time. Just as one can track the path of a jet by 
the smoke path it leaves behind, computer graphics provide a way to follow paths of 
particles whose motion is determined by simple differential equations. The practical side 
of dynamical systems is that they can sometimes be used to describe real-world behaviors 
such as fluid flows, the vibration of bridges, the orbital motion of satellites, the control of 
robotic arms, and the response of electrical circuits. Often the resulting graphic patterns 
resemble smoke, swirls, candle flames, and windy mists. 

The Ikeda attractor, shown here, is an example of a strange attractor, which has an 
irregular, unpredictable behavior. An attractor is a set to which a dynamical system 
evolves, or settles to, after some amount of time. With “tame” attractors, initially close 
points stay together as they approach the attractor. With strange attractors, initially 
adjacent points eventually follow widely divergent trajectories. As with leaves in a turbulent 
stream, it is impossible to predict where the leaves will end up given their initial positions. 

In 1979, Japanese theoretical physicist Kensuke Ikeda published “Multiple-Valued 
Stationary State and Its Instability of the Transmitted Light by a Ring Cavity System,” 
which describes a variation of this attractor. Numerous other famous attractors and 
related mathematical mappings exist in the mathematical literature, including the 
Lorenz attractor, logistic map, Arnold’s cat map, horseshoe map, Henon map, and 
Rossler map.

Spidrons 

Daniel Erddly (b. 1956) 

Journalist Ivars Peterson writes of Spidrons, “A field of triangles crumples and twists into 
a wavy crystalline sea. A crystal ball sprouts spiraling, labyrinthine passages. Faceted 
bricks stack snugly into a tidy, compact structure. Underlying each of these objects is a 
remarkable geometric shape made up of a sequence of triangles—a spiral polygon that 
resembles a seahorse's tai l.” 

In 1979, graphic artist Daniel Erdfly created an example of the Spidron system, as a 
part of his homework for Emo Rubik’s theory of form class at the Budapest University of 
Art and Design. Erd6ly had experimented with earlier versions of this work as early as 1975. 

To create a Spidron, draw an equilateral triangle, and then draw lines from the 
three comers of the triangle to a point at its center, creating three identical isosceles 
triangles. Next, draw a reflection of one of these isosceles triangles so that it juts from 
the side of the original triangle. Create a new, smaller equilateral triangle, using one 
of the two short sides of the jutting isosceles triangle as a base. By repeating 
the procedure, you’ll create a spiraling triangulated structure that gets 
increasingly small. Finally, you can erase the original equilateral triangle, 
and join two of the triangulated structures along the long side of the largest 
isosceles triangle to create the seahorse shape. 

The Spidron s significance arises from its remarkable spatial properties, 
including its ability to form various space-filling polyhedra and tiling 
patterns. If we crawl like an ant along the deeper regions of the seahorse’s 
tail, we find that the area of any equilateral triangle equals the sum of the 
areas of all the smaller triangles. The infinite collection of smaller triangles 
could all be crammed into such an equilateral triangle without overlap. 
When crinkled in just the right manner, Spidrons provide an infinite 
reservoir for magnificent 3-D sculptures. Possible practical examples of

Mandelbrot Set 


Benoit B. Mandelbrot (b. 1924) 

David Darling writes that the Mandelbrot set, or M-set for short, is the ‘'best known 
fractal and one of the most.. .beautiful mathematical objects known." The Guinness 
Book of World Records called it “the most complicated object in mathematics.” Arthur 
C. Clarke emphasizes the degree to which the computer is useful for gaining insight 
“In principle, [the Mandelbrot set] could have been discovered as soon as men learned 
to count But even if they never grew tired, and never made a mistake, all the human 
beings who have ever existed would not have sufficed to do the elementary arithmetic 
required to produce a Mandelbrot set of quite modest magnification.” 

The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, an object that continues to exhibit similar structural 
details no matter how much the edge of the object is magnified. Think of the beautiful 
M-set images as being produced by mathematical feedback loops. In feet, the set is 
produced by iteration, or repetition, of the very simple formula z n + \ = z n 2 + c, for 
complex values of z and c, and for zq = 0. The set contains all points for which the formula 
does not produce values that diverge to infinity. The first crude pictures of the M-set 
were drawn in 1978 by Robert Brooks and Peter Matelski, followed by the landmark 
paper by Mandelbrot in 1980 on its fractal aspects and the wealth of geometric and 
algebraic information it conveys. 

The M-set structure contains super-thin spiral and crinkly paths, connecting an 
infinite number of island shapes. Computer magnifications of the M-set will easily yield 
pictures never seen before by human eyes. The incredible vastness of the M-set led 
authors Tim Wegner and Mark Peterson to remark: “You may have heard of a company 
that for a fee will name a star after you and record it in a book Maybe the same thing 
will soon be done with the Mandelbrot set!”

Monster Group 

Robert L. Griess, Jr. (b. 1945) 

In 1981, American mathematician Robert Griess constructed the Monster—the largest 
and one of the most mysterious of the so-called sporadic groups, a particular set of 
groups in the field of Group Theory. The quest to comprehend the Monster has helped 
mathematicians understand some of the basic building blocks of symmetry and how 
such building blocks, along with some of their exceptional subfamilies, can be used to 
solve deep problems involving symmetry in mathematics and in mathematical physics. 
We can think of the Monster group as a mind-boggling snowflake with more than 10 5? 
symmetries that exists in a space of 196,884 dimensions! 

Griess said that he became “addicted” to Monster construction in 1979, the year he 
was married—and his wife was “very understanding” during his intense pursuit, when 
he took time off only on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. In 1982, his 102-page paper 
on the Monster was finally published. Mathematicians marveled that Griess could 
construct the Monster without using a computer. 

More than a mere curiosity, the structure of the Monster suggests deep connections 
between symmetry and physics, and it may even have a connection with string theory, 
which posits that all of the fundamental particles in the universe are made of tiny 
vibrating loops of energy. Mark Ronan, in his book Symmetry and the Monster, writes 
that the Monster has “arrived before its time—a piece of twenty-second-century 
mathematics that slipped by chance into the 20th century.” In 1983, physicist Freeman 
Dyson wrote that the Monster may be “built in some unsuspected way into the structure 
of the universe.” 

In 1973, Griess and Bemd Fischer predicted the existence of the Monster, and John 
Conway gave the object its name. In 1998, Richard Borcherds was awarded a Fields 
Medal for his work on understanding the Monster and its profound connections with 
other areas of mathematics and physics.

Ball Triangle Picking 

Glen Richard Hall (b. 1954) 

In 1982, Glen Hall published his famous research paper “Acute Triangles in the n-Ball.” 
This was Hall’s first published mathematics paper, and it discusses work he conducted 
while taking a graduate school class on geometric probability, taught at the University 
of Minnesota. Imagine picking three points at random in a circle to create a triangle. 
Hall wondered what the probability would be for obtaining an “acute triangle,” not just 
for triangles inside a circle but also in higher dimensions, such as inside spheres and 
hyperspheres. These generalizations of a circle are called n-dimensional balls. An acute 
triangle is one in which each of the three angles is less than 90 degrees. 

Below are several values for P n , the probability of picking an acute triangle in an 
n-ball if the three points on the triangle are chosen independently and uniformly: 

P 2 = 4/tt 2 -1/8 = 0.280285 (circle) 

P 3 = 33/70 0.471429 (sphere) 

P 4 = 256/(457T 2 ) + 1/32 *=» 0.607655 (four-dimensional hypersphere) 

P 5 = 1415/2002 ~ 0.706793 (five-dimensional hypersphere) 

P 6 = 2048/(3157T 2 ) + 31/256 0.779842 (six-dimensional hypersphere) 

Hall noticed that as the dimension of the sphere increased, foe probability of choosing 
an acute triangle also increased. By foe time we reach foe ninth dimension, we 
have a probability of 0.905106 of selecting an acute triangle. The triangle work is 
notable in that mathematicians had no generalization of triangle picking to higher 
dimensions until the early 1980s. Hall, in a personal communication to me, notes 
that he was amazed by foe potential alternation of probabilities between rational and 
irrational solutions according to foe dimension of foe ball, a dimensional oscillation 
that mathematicians would probably never have conjectured before this research. 
Rational numbers are those that can be expressed by a ratio of two integers. Note that 
mathematician Christian Buchta in 1986 was responsible for providing closed-form 
evaluations for Hall’s integrals.

Jones Polynomial 

Vaughan Frederick Randal Jones (b. 1952) 

In mathematics, even the most tangled loop in three dimensions can be represented as a 
projection, or shadow, on a flat surface. When mathematical knots are diagrammed, tiny 
breaks in the lines often indicate when a strand crosses over or under another strand. 

One of the goals of knot theory is to find invariants of knots, where the term 
invariant refers to a mathematical characteristic or value that is the same for equivalent 
knots so that it can be used to show that two knots are different In 1984, knot theorists 
were all abuzz with a startling invention of New Zealand mathematician Vaughan 
Jones, an invariant, now called the Jones polynomial, that could distinguish more knots 
than any previous invariant. Jones had made his breakthrough discovery by chance, 
while working on a physics problem. Mathematician Keith Devlin writes, “Sensing that 
he had stumbled onto an unexpected, hidden connection, Jones consulted knot theorist 
Joan Birman, and the rest, as they say, is history...Jones's research “opened the way 
to a whole array of new polynomial invariants, and led to a dramatic rise in research in 
knot theory, some of it spurred on by the growing awareness of exciting new applications 
in both biology and physics....” Biologists who study DNA strands are interested in knots 
and how they can help elucidate the functioning of genetic material in cells or even aid in 
resistance to viral attacks. A systematic procedure, or algorithm, allows mathematicians to 
express the Jones polynomial for any knot, based on its pattern of crossings. 

The use of knot invariants has had a long history. Around 1928, James W. Alexander 
(1888-1971) introduced the first polynomial associated with knots. Alas, the 
Alexander polynomial was not useable for detecting the difference between a knot and 
its mirror image, something that the Jones polynomial could do. Four months after Jones 
announced his new polynomial, the more general HOMFLY polynomial was announced.

Weeks Manifold 


Jeffrey Renwick Weeks (b. 1956) 


Hyperbolic geometry is a Non-Euclidean Geometry in which Euclid's parallel 
postulate does not hold. In this geometry for two dimensions, for any line and any point 
not on it, many other lines pass through the point without intersecting the first line. 
Hyperbolic geometry is sometimes visualized using saddle-shaped surfaces on which 
the sum of angles of a triangle is less than 180 degrees. Such strange geometries have 
implications for mathematicians and even cosmologists who ponder possible properties 
and shapes for our universe. 

In 2007, David Gabai of Princeton University, Robert Meyerhoff of Boston College, 
and Peter Milley of the University of Melbourne in Australia proved that a particular 
hyperbolic three-dimensional space, or 3-manifold, has least volume. This shape, called 
the Weeks manifold after its discoverer American mathematician Jeffrey Weeks, holds 
immense interest to topologists who catalogue shapes of this kind. 

In traditional Euclidean geometry, the concept of a "least volume” for a three- 
dimensional space is meaningless. Shapes and volumes can be scaled to any size. 
However, the spatial curvature of hyperbolic geometry provides an intrinsic unit for 
length, area, and volume. In 1985, Weeks had found a small manifold with a volume of 
approximately 0.94270736. (The Weeks manifold is related to the space around a pair 
of intertwined loops, known as the Whitehead link.) Until 2007, no one knew for sure if 
the Weeks manifold was the smallest 

MacArthur Fellow Jeffrey Weeks received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton 
University in 1985, under the supervision of William Thurston. One of his main 
passions is the use of topology to bridge the gap between geometry and observational 
cosmology. He has also developed interactive software to introduoe geometry to young 
students and to let them explore universes that are finite yet have no boundaries.

This model of a Weeks manifold contains only one galaxy, but we see images of that galaxy repeating in a 
crystalline pattern, giving the illusion of an infinite space The effect is similar to a hall of minors, which also 
gives an illusion of infinite space

Andrica s Conjecture 

Dorin Andrica (b. 1956) 

A prime number is an integer that has exactly two distinct integer divisors: 1 and itself. 
Examples of prime numbers include 2, 5, 5,7,11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. The 
great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) remarked, “Mathematicians 
have tried in vain to this day to discover some order in the sequence of prime numbers, 
and we have reason to believe that it is a mystery into which the mind will never 
penetrate." Mathematicians have long searched for patterns in the sequence of prime 
numbers and also in the gaps between them, where the term gap refers to the difference 
between two successive prime numbers. The value of the average gap between primes 
increases as the natural logarithm of the prime number at either end of the gap. As 
an example of a known large gap, consider the gap of 879 non-prime numbers after 
the prime 277,900,416,100,927. In 2009, the largest known prime gap had a length of 
337,446. 

In 1985, Romanian mathematician Dorin Andrica published “Andrica's 
Conjecture,” which concerns the gaps between prime numbers. In particular, the 
conjecture states that Jp n +\ - Jp^ < 1, where p n is the nth prime number. For example, 
consider the prime numbers 23 and 29. Applying Andrica’s conjecture, we have 
729 — JTi < 1. Another way of writing this is g n < 2 Jp^ + 1, where g n is the nth prime 
gap, and £ n = p n +\ ~ Pn- As of 2008, the conjecture has been shown to hold true for n 
up to 1.3002 x 10 16 . 

If we examine the left side of the inequality in Andrica’s conjecture, A n = Jp n +\ - 
Jp 7. the highest value for ever found is at n = 4, where is approximately equal 

to 0.67087. Andrica’s conjecture was stated just at the time when computers were 
becoming ubiquitous, which encouraged an ongoing fluny of activity in an attempt to 
understand and find counterexamples that might defeat the conjecture. So far, Andrica’s 
conjecture still stands, although it also remains unproven.

The ABC Conjecture 

David Masser (b. 1948), Joseph Oesterle (b. 1954) 

The ABC conjecture is considered to be one of the most important unsolved problems 
in number theory, the study of the properties of whole numbers. If the conjecture is 
correct, mathematicians will be able to prove many other famous theorems in just a 
few lines. 

The conjecture was first advanced in 1985 by mathematicians Joseph Oesterle 
and David Masser. To understand the conjecture, we define a square-free number as an 
integer that is not divisible by the square of any number. For example, 13 is square-free, 
but 9 (divisible by 3 2 ) is not. The square-free part of an integer n, denoted sqp(n), is the 
largest square-free number that can be formed by multiplying the prime factors of n. 
Thus, for n — 15, the prime factors are 5 and 3, and 3 x 5 = 15, a square-free number. 
So sqp(l 5) = 15. On the other hand, for n = 8, the prime factors are all 2, which means 
thatsqp(8) = 2. Similarly, sqp(18) = 6, which is found by multiplying its factors 3 and 2, 
and sqp(13) = 13. 

Next, consider numbers A and B drat have no factors in common, and C is their 
sum. For example, consider A = 3 and B = 7 and C = 10. The square-free part of the 
product ABC is 210. Notice that sqp(ABC) is greater than C, but this is not always 
the case. It is possible to prove that the ratio sqp(ABC)/C can get arbitrarily small for 
the appropriate selection of A, B, and C. However, the ABC conjecture states that 
[sqp(ABC)] n /C does reach a minimum value if n is any real number greater than 1. 

Dorian Goldfeld writes, “The ABC conjecture.. .is more than utilitarian; to mathe¬ 
maticians it is also a thing of beauty. Seeing so many Diophantine [integer-solution] 
problems unexpectedly encapsulated into a single equation drives home the feeling that 
all the subdisciplines of mathematics are aspects of a single underlying unity....”

Audioactive Sequence 

John Horton Conway (b. 1937) 

Consider the following sequence of numbers: 1,11, 21, 1211, 111221,... To appreciate 
how Ihe sequence is formed, it helps to speak the entries in each row out loud. Note 
that the second entry has two “ones,” thereby giving the 21 for the third entry. The third 
entry has one “two” and one “one.” Extending this pattern, an entire sequence can be 
generated. The sequence was extensively studied by mathematician John Conway, who 
called the process “audioactive ” 

The sequence grows rather rapidly. For example, row 16 is 1321132132211331 
12132113311211131221121321131211132221123113112221131112311332111213 
211322211312113211. If you were to carefully study the sequence, you would find a 
predominance of Is, with 2s and 3s less common, and no numbers greater than 3. 

Is it possible to prove that 333 can never occur? You can see from the following 
representation of Row 11 (in which 3s are represented by “) that the occurrence of 3 
seems erratic, like lost ships on an infinite sea: ™^"-■- ■— 1 ■—- 


The number of digits in the nth term of this sequence is roughly proportional to 
Conway’s constant (1.3035772690342693912570991121525518907307025046594...)". 
Mathematicians have found it remarkable that the "bizarre” audioactive construction 
process yields this constant that turns out to be a unique positive real root of a 
polynomial equation. Interestingly, the constant applies to all starting sequences, with 
the exception of 22. 

Many variants exist British researcher Roger Hargrave has extended the idea to 
a variation in which a row takes into account all occurrences of each character in a 
previous row. For example, the sequence starting with 123 is 123,111213,411213. 
14311213,... Interestingly, he believes that all his sequences finally oscillate between 
23322114 and 32232114. Can you prove this? What are the properties of reverse 
likeness-sequences? Starting from a particular row, can one work backward and compute 
the starting string of symbols? 

SEE ALSO Thue-Morse Sequence (1906), Collate Conjecture (1937), and The On-Line Encyclopedia of 
Integer Sequences (1996) 


The strange construction method for the audioactive process yields Conway's constant, 1 3035 .., which turns 
out to be a unique positive real root of a 69-term polynomial equation. This root is at the location of the yellow 
sphere. Other roots of this polynomial are shown as + symbols.

Mathematica 


Stephen Wolfram (b. 1959) 

A shift has taken place in the way mathematics has been practiced over the last 20 years— 
a transition from pure theory and proof to the use of computers and experimentation. 
This shift is due, in part, to computational software packages like Mathematica, sold 
by Wolfram Research of Champaign, Illinois, and developed by mathematician and 
theorist Stephen Wolfram. The first version of Mathematica was released in 1988, 
and today it provides a general computing environment that organizes numerous 
algorithmic, visualization, and user-interface capabilities. Mathematica is one example 
of numerous packages available today for experimental mathematics, including Maple, 
Mathcad, MATLAB, and Maxima. 

Since the 1960s, individual software packages have existed for specific numerical, 
algebraic, graphical, and other tasks, and researchers interested in chaos and fractals 
have long used computers for their explorations. Mathematica helped unite various 
features of specialized packages in a convenient fashion. Today, Mathematica is used 
in engineering, science, finance, education, art, clothing design, and other fields that 
require visualization and experimentation. 

In 1992, the journal Experimental Mathematics was launched and helped to show 
how computation can be used to investigate mathematical structures and identify 
important properties and patterns. Educator and author David Berlinski writes, “The 
computer has... changed the very nature of mathematical experience, suggesting for 
the first time that mathematics, like physics, may yet become an empirical discipline, a 
place where things are discovered because they are seen.” 

Mathematicians Jonathan Borwein and David Bailey write, “Perhaps the most 
important advancement along this line is the development of broad spectrum 
mathematical software products such as Mathematica and Maple. These days, many 
mathematicians are highly skilled with these tools and use them as part of their day-to- 
day research work. As a result, we are starting to see a wave of new mathematica] results 
discovered partly or entirely with the aid of computer-based tools.”

Murphy’s Law and Knots 

De Witt L. Sumners (b. 1941), Stuart G. Whittington (b. 1942) 


Since ancient days, frustrated sailors and weavers have observed the apparent tendency 
of ropes and strings to tangle and knot—a manifestation of Murphy’s famous law that 
states, if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. However, until recently, no rigorous 
theory existed that explained this maddening phenomenon. Consider just one practical 
ramification: A single knot in a mountain climber’s rope can reduce the amount of stress 
the rope can withstand without breaking by as much as 50 percent 

In 1988, mathematician De Witt L. Sumners and chemist Stuart G. Whittington 
clearly elucidated the phenomena by modeling ropes and other string-like objects, such 
as chemical polymer chains, as self-avoiding random walks. Imagine an ant resting at 
a point in a cubic grid. It can randomly walk in any of six directions as it traces a path 
through the lattice (meaning backward or forward in any of three directions). In order 
to mimic physical objects that cannot occupy the same space at once, the ant’s walk is 
self-avoiding so that no point in space is visited more than once. Based on their research, 
Sumners and Whittington proved a general result Nearly all sufficiently long self¬ 
avoiding random walks contain a knot 

Not only does their research help to explain why the longer a garden hose in 
your garage is, the more likely it is to be knotted—or why a knotted rope found at 
a crime scene may have no forensic significance—this work has 
vast implications for our understanding of the tangling of DNA 
and protein backbones. Long ago, protein folding experts believed 
that forming a knot was beyond the ability of a protein, but today 
a number of such knots have been found. Some of the knots may 
stabilize the protein structure. If scientists can accurately predict 
protein structure, they may be able to better understand diseases and 
develop new drugs that rely on a 3-D shape of the protein.

Butterfly Curve 

Temple H. Fay (b. 1940) 

Parameterizations are sets of equations that express a set of quantities as functions of a 
number of independent variables. A curve in the plane is often said to be parameterized 
if the set of coordinates (x, y) on the curve is represented as functions of a variable t. For 
example, in the usual Cartesian coordinates, we have the standard equation of a circle: 
x 2 + y 2 = r 2 , where r is the radius of the circle. We can also define a circle in terms of 
parametric equations: x = r-cos(f), y = r-sin(f), where 0 < t ^ 360 degrees or 0 < t ^ 2tt 
radians. To create a graph, computer programmers increment the value for t and 
connect the resultant (x, y) points. 

Mathematicians and computer artists often resort to parametric representations 
because certain geometric forms are very difficult to describe as a single equation, the 
way one could for a circle. For example, to draw a conical helix, try x = cr-z-sin(f), y = 
tz-z-cos(f), and z = t/(2irc), where a and c are constants. Conical helices are used today 
in certain lands of antennas. 

Many algebraic and transcendental curves express beauty in their symmetry, leaves 
and lobes, and asymptotic behavior. Butterfly curves, developed by Temple Fay while 
at the University of Southern Mississippi, are one such class of beautiful, intricate 
shapes. The equation for the butterfly curve can be expressed in polar coordinates by 
p = e cos ® - 2cos(4 6) + sin 5 (0/12). This formula describes the trajectory of a point as it 
traces out the butterfly’s body. The variable p is the radial distance of the point to the 
origin. The butterfly curve is significant because of the degree to which it has fascinated 
both students and mathematicians since 1989 when it was first presented, and it has 
encouraged students to experiment with variants with longer periods of repetition such 
as p = - 2.1cos(60) + sin 7 (0/3O).

The On-Line Encyclopedia of 
Integer Sequences 

Neil James Alexander Sloane (b. 1939) 


The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is an extremely large, searchable 
database of integer sequences used by mathematicians, scientists, and laypeople who are 
intrigued by number sequences in disciplines ranging from game theory, puzzles, and 
number theory to chemistry, communications, and physics. The astonishing diversity of 
the OEIS is exemplified by two sample entries: the number of ways to lace a shoe that 
has n pairs of eyelets, and the winning positions of the ancient board game Tchoukaillon 
solitaire, as a function of the number of stones. The Web site for the OEIS (www. 
research.att.com/~njas/sequences/) contains more than 150,000 sequences, making it 
the largest database of its kind. 

Each entry includes the first several terms of the sequence, keywords, mathematical 
motivations, and literature references. Neil Sloane, British-bom American mathema¬ 
tician, started collecting integer sequences in 1963, as a graduate student at Cornell 
University, and his first incarnation of the OEIS was stored on punched cards—and 
then in the form of a 1973 book called A Handbook of Integer Sequences, containing 
2,400 sequences, and a 1995 follow-up with 5,487 sequences. The Web version became 
available in 1996, and it continues to add about 10,000 new entries a year. If it were 
published as a book today, it would occupy 750 volumes the size of the 1995 book. 

The OEIS is a monumental achievement and is frequently used to identify 
sequences or to determine the current status of a known sequence. However, its most 
profound use may be as an aid for suggesting new conjectures. For example, mathe¬ 
matician Ralf Stephan recently formulated more than 100 conjectures in many fields 
simply through a study of the OEIS number sequences. By comparing sequences 
with the same leading terms (or sequences related by simple transformations), mathe¬ 
maticians may start to consider new conjectures concerning power series expansions, 
number theory, combinatorics, nonlinear recurrences, binary representations, and 
other areas of mathematics.

Eternity Puzzle 

Christopher Walter Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton 
of Brenchley (b. 1952) 

The extremely difficult jigsaw puzzle known as the Eternity Puzzle became a craze in 
1999 and 2000 and has been subject to serious mathematical and computer analysis. 
The 209 puzzle pieces, all different, are constructed from equilateral triangles and half 
triangles with the same total areas as six triangles. The task is to fit the pieces together 
into one large, almost regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon). 

Christopher Monckton, inventor of the puzzle, announced a prize of 1 million 
pounds when the puzzle was released commercially by Ertl Toys in June, 1999. 
Moncktoris initial computer experiments suggested to him that the puzzle would not 
be solved for several years or perhaps much longer. Indeed, exhaustively searching all 
possibilities would take so long that the fastest computer would have required many 
millions of years to find a solution using simple-minded searches. 

Perhaps to Monckton's disappointment, two British mathematicians, Alex Selby and 
Oliver Riordan, revealed a correct tiling on May 15, 2000, which they obtained with 
the help of computers, and they claimed the prize. Interestingly, they discovered that 
as the number of pieces in an Etemity-like puzzle increased, the difficulty increased 
up to about 70 pieces. However, beyond 70 pieces, the number of possible correct 
solutions begins to increase. The official Eternity Puzzle is thought to have at least I0 95 
solutions—far more than the number of atoms in our galaxy. Nevertheless, the puzzle is 
still fiendishly difficult because for more non-solutions exist 

Because Selby and Riordan realized that many solutions should be possible, 
they decided to deliberately discard Monckton’s clues for his own solution in order to 
consider possibly easier solutions. In 2007, Monckton released the Eternity II Puzzle 
with 256 square puzzle pieces, whose colored edges must match when the pieces are 
fit into a 16 x 16 grid. The possible number of configurations is estimated to be 
1.115 x 10 557 .

Perfect Magic Tesseract 

John Robert Hendricks (1929-2007) 

The traditional Magic Square contains integers arranged in the form of a square grid 
so that the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal add up to the same total If the 
integers are consecutive numbers from 1 to N 2 , the square is said to be of Nth order. 

In a magic tesseract (a four-dimensional cube), the object contains the numbers 1 
through N 4 arranged in such a way that the sum of the numbers in each of the N 3 rows, 
N 3 columns, N 3 pillars, N 3 files (a term used to imply a fourth spatial direction), and in 
the 8 major quadragonals (that pass through the center and join opposite comers) is a 
constant sum S = N(1 + N 4 )/2, where N is the order of the tesseract A total of 22,272 
magic tesseracts exist of order 3, 

The term perfect magic tesseract implies that a magic sum is achieved not only 
in the rows, columns, pillars, files, and quadragonals, but also in all the diagonals and 
triagonals (space diagonals of the cubes of the tesseract). A perfect magic tesseract 
requires all cubes to be perfect, and all squares must be perfect (that is, pandiagonal so 
that all of the broken diagonals of the square add up to the magic constant). 

Canadian researcher John Hendricks was one of the world’s foremost experts in 
higher-dimensional magic objects, and he proved that a perfect magic tesseract cannot 
be achieved with any orders below 16 and that a perfect magic tesseract of order 16 
exists. This perfect magic tesseract of order 16 contains the numbers 1, 2, 3,. ..65,536 
and has die magic sum of 534,296. In 1999, he and I computed the first-known perfect 
16th-order magic tesseract. We can summarize what is known today: The smallest 
perfect tesseract is of order 16, the smallest perfect cube is of order 8, and the smallest 
perfect (pandiagonal) magic square is of order 4.

An order-16 perfect magic tesseract is difficult to visualize, so we display one of John Hendrick's third-order magic 
tesseracts, showing a sample row (yellow), column (green), pillar (red), file (light blue), and quadragonal (formed 
by the three magenta numbers) that sum to 123. 




Parrondo s Paradox 


Juan Manuel Rodriguez Parrondo (b. 1964) 

In the late 1990s, Spanish physicist Juan Parrondo showed how two games guaranteed 
to make a player lose all his money can be played in alternating sequence to make the 
player rich. Science writer Sandra Blakeslee writes that Parrondo “discovered what 
appears to be a new law of nature that may help explain, among other things, how life 
arose out of a primordial soup, why President Clinton's popularity rose after he was 
caught in a sex scandal, and why investing in losing stocks can sometimes lead to greater 
capital gains ” The mind-boggling paradox has applications ranging horn population 
dynamics to the assessment of financial risk. 

To understand the paradox, imagine you are playing two gambling games that 
involve biased coins. In game A, each time the coin is tossed, you have a probability Pj 
of winning that is less than 50 percent, expressed as Pi = 0.5 - x. If you win, you get 
$ 1 ; otherwise, you lose $1. In game B, you first examine your earnings to see if they are 
a multiple of 3. If no, you toss another biased coin with the probability of winning 
Pi = (3/4 - x). If yes, you toss a third biased coin with the probability of winning a mere 
P 3 = (1/10) - x. In game A or game B played separately, for example with x = 0.005, you 
are guaranteed to lose in the long run. However, if you play them alternately (or even if 
you randomly switch between the games), you ’11 eventually be rich beyond your wildest 
dreams! Note that the outcome of game A affects game B during this alternation of play. 

Parrondo initially devised his paradoxical game in 1996. Biomedical engineer Derek 
Abbott at the University of Adelaide, Australia, coined the term Parrondo’s paradox, and, 
in 1999, he published his work that verified Parrondo’s counterintuitive result

Solving of the Holyhedron 

John Horton Conway (b. 1937), Jade P. Vinson (b. 1976) 


Consider a traditional polyhedral solid constructed from a collection of polygons joined 
at their edges. A holyhedron is a polyhedron with each face containing at least one 
polygon-shaped hole. The boundaries of the holes share no point with each other or the 
boundary of the faces. For example, consider a solid cube with its 6 faces. Next, imagine 
thrusting a pentagonal rod through 1 face, all the way through the cube to the other 
side to produce (for example) a pentagonal tunnel. At this point in the construction, 
we have created an object with 11 faces (the 6 original feces and the 5 new feces of the 
pentagonal tunnel), and only 2 of those 11 feces have holes punched in them. Each 
time we punch a hole, we are also creating more feces. The immense challenge to 
finding a holyhedron is to make the holes such that they eventually punch through 
more than one face to reduce the number of feces that have no holes. 


The holyhedron concept was first introduced by Princeton mathematician John H. 
Conway in the 1990s, who offered a prize of $10,000 to anyone who could find such an 
object. He also stipulated that his cash reward would be divided by the number of feces 
in such an object. In 1997, David W. Wilson coined the word holyhedron to indicate a 
hole-filled polyhedron. 

Finally, in 1999, American mathematician Jade P. Vinson discovered the world’s 
first holyhedron specimen with a total of 78,585,627 feces (which, obviously, made 
Vinson's monetary award rather small)! In 2003, computer graphics specialist Don 
Hatch discovered a holyhedron with 492 feces. The search continues.

Bed Sheet Problem 


Britney Gallivan (b. 1985) 

You have insomnia one night and decide to remove your bed sheet, which is only about 
0.4 millimeter thick. You fold it up once, and it becomes 0.8 mm thick. How many 
times do you fold it if you want to make the bed sheet thickness equal to the distance 
between the Earth and the moon? The remarkable answer is that if you fold your sheet 
only 40 times, then you will sleep on the moon! In another version of the problem, you 
are handed a sheet of paper with a typical thickness of 0.1 millimeter. If you could fold it 
51 times, the stack would reach further than the sun! 

Alas, it is not physically possible to create many folds in physical objects like these. 
The prevailing wisdom throughout much of the 1900s was that a sheet of real paper 
could not be folded in half more than 7 or 8 times, even if the starting paper sheet was 
large. However, in 2002, high school student Britney Gallivan shocked the world by 
folding a sheet in half an unexpected 12 times. 

In 2001, Gallivan determined equations that characterize the limit on the number 
of times we can fold a sheet of paper of a given size in a single direction. For the case of 
a sheet with thickness t, we can estimate the initial minimal length L of a paper that is 
required in order to achieve n folds: L = [(7rt)/6] x (2” + 4) x (2 n - 1). We may study 
the behavior of (2 n + 4) x (2 n - 1). Starting with n = 0, we have the integer sequence 
0,1,4,14, 50,186, 714, 2,794, 11,050,43,946,175,274,700,074.... This means that for 
the eleventh act of folding the paper in half, 700,074 times as much material has been 
lost to folding, at the curved edges along the folds, as was lost on the first fold.

Solving the Game of Awari 

John W. Romein (b. 1970) and Henri E. Bal (b. 1958) 


Awari is a 3,500-year-old African board game. Today, Awari is the national game of Ghana, 
and it is played throughout West Africa and the Caribbean. Classified as a count-and- 
capture game, Awari is a member of a set of strategy games called Mancala games. 

The Awari board consists of two rows of six cup-like hollows, with four markers 
(beans, seeds, or pebbles) in each hollow. Six cups belong to each player, who takes 
turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of his six cups, withdraws all 
seeds from that cup, and drops one seed in each cup counterclockwise from this cup. 
The second player then takes the seeds from one of the six cups on his side and does the 
same. When a player drops his last seed into a cup on the opponent’s side containing 
only one or two seeds (making a total of two or three seeds), that player removes all the 
seeds from this cup, removing them from the game. The same player also takes any 
seeds in cups immediately before the emptied cup if they now also total two or three. 
Players take seeds only from their opponent’s side of the board. The game ends when 
one player has no seeds left in the cups on his side. Whoever captures the majority of 
seeds wins. 

Awari has been of immense attraction to researchers in the field of artificial 
intelligence, in which algorithms are sometimes developed to solve puzzles or play 
games, but until 2002, no one knew if the game was like Tic Tac Toe in which perfect 
players always ended a game in a draw. Finally, computer scientists John W. Romein 
and Henri E. Bal of the Free University in Amsterdam wrote a computer program that 
calculated the outcome for all 889,063,398,406 positions that can occur in the game, 
and proved that Awari must end in a draw for perfect players. The massive computation 
required about 51 hours on a computer cluster with 144 processors.

Tetris Is NP-Complete 

Erik D. Demaine (b. 1981), Susan Hohenberger (b. 1978), and 
David Liben-Nowell (b. 1977) 

Tetris is a very popular falling-blocks puzzle video game, invented in 1985 by Russian 
computer engineer Alexey Pajitnov. In 2002, American computer scientists quantified 
the difficulty of the game and showed that it has similarities with the hardest problems 
in mathematics that do not have simple solutions but instead require exhaustive analysis 
to find optimal solutions. 

In Tetris, playing pieces start at the top of the game board and move downward. 

As a piece descends, a player can rotate the piece or slide it sideways. The pieces are 
shapes called tetrominoes, consisting of four squares stuck together into a group that has 
a shape like the letter T or other simple pattern. When one piece reaches a resting spot 
at the bottom, the next piece at the top falls. Whenever a row at the bottom is filled with 
no gaps, that row is removed, and all higher rows drop down one row. The game ends 
when a new piece cannot fall because it is blocked. The player’s goal is to make the 
game last as long as possible in order to increase his score. 

In 2002, Erik D. Demaine, Susan Hohenberger, and David Liben-Nowell 
researched a generalized version of the game that used a game board grid that could 
be any number of squares wide and high. The team discovered that if they tried to 
maximize the number of rows cleared while playing a given sequence of pieces, then the 
game was NP-complete. (“NP” stands for “nondeterministically polynomial.”) Although 
this class of problems can be checked to determine if a solution is correct, the solution 
may actually require an outrageously long time to find. The classic example of an 
NP-complete problem is the traveling salesman problem, which involves the extremely 
challenging task of determining the most efficient route for a salesman or delivery man 
who must visit many different towns. These kinds of problems are difficult because no 
shortcut or smart algorithm exists for quick solutions.

NUMB3RS 


Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton 

NUMB3RS is an American television show created by husband-and-wife writing team 
Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton. This crime drama concerns a brilliant mathemati¬ 
cian, Charlie Epps, who helps the FBI solve crimes using his genius ability in mathematics. 

Although it may seem inappropriate to place a TV show in a book along with 
such famous concepts as Fermat's Last Theorem or the work of Euclid, NUMB3RS 
is significant because it was the first very popular weekly drama that revolved around 
mathematics, had a team of mathematician advisors, and also received acclaim from 
mathematicians. The equations seen in the show are real and relevant to the episodes. 
The mathematical content of the show ranges from cryptanalysis, probability theory, and 
Fourier analysis to Bayesian analysis and basic geometry. 

NUMB3RS has also proven to be significant because it has created many learning 
opportunities for students. For example, mathematics teachers have employed the lessons 
of NUMB 3 RS in their classrooms, and in 2007, the show and its creators received a 
National Science Board group Public Service Award for contributions toward increasing 
scientific and mathematical literacy. Famous mathematicians mentioned in NUMB3RS 
include Archimedes, Paul Erdos, Pierre-Simon Laplace, John von Neumann, Bernhard 
Riemann, and Stephen Wolfram—the kinds of people discussed throughout this book! 
Kendrick Frazier writes, “Science, reason, and rational thinking play such a prominent 
role in die stories that the American Association for the Advancement of Science hosted 
an entire afternoon symposium at its 2006 annual meeting on the program’s role in 
changing the public’s perception of mathematics” 

Episodes begin with a spoken tribute about the importance of mathematics: "We 
all use math everywhere. To tell time, to predict the weather, to handle money... .Math is 
more than formulas and equations. Math is more than numbers. It is logic. It is ration¬ 
ality. It is using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.”

Checkers Is Solved 


Jonathan Schaeffer (b. 1957) 

In 2007, computer scientist Jonathan Schaeffer and colleagues used computers to finally 
prove that checkers, when played perfectly, is a no-win game. This means that checkers 
resembles Tic Tac Toe—a game that also can't be won if both players make no wrong 
moves. Both games end in a draw. 

Schaeffer's proof was executed by hundreds of computers over 18 years, making 
checkers the most complex game ever solved. This also means that it is theoretically 
possible to build a machine that will never lose to a human. 

Checkers, which makes use of an 8 x 8 board, was hugely popular in Europe in 
the sixteenth century, and early variations of the game have been discovered in the ruins 
of the ancient city of Ur (c. 3000 B.C.) in modem-day Iraq. The checkers pieces are 
often in the form of black and red disks that slide diagonally. Players take turns and 
capture each other’s pieces by hopping over them. Of course, given that there are 
roughly 5 x 10 20 possible positions, proving that checkers is a guaranteed draw is far 
harder than proving that Tic Tac Toe can’t be won. 

The checkers research team considered 39,000 billion arrangements with 10 or 
fewer pieces on the board and then determined if red or black would win. The team 
also used a specialized search algorithm to study the start of the game and to see how 
these moves Tunneled” into the 10-checker configurations. The solving of checkers 
represented a major benchmark in the field of artificial intelligence, which often 
involves complex problem-solving strategies for computers. 

In 1994, Schaeffer's program called Chinook played the world champion, Marion 
Tinsley, to a series of draws. Tinsley died of cancer eight months later, and some chided 
Schaeffer for accelerating the death due to the stress Chinook placed on Tinsley!

French artist Louis-Uopold BoiUy ( 1761-1845) painted this scene of a family game of checkers around the year

The Quest for Lie Group E g 

Marius Sophus Lie (1842—1899), Wilhelm Karl Joseph Killing (1847—1923) 


For more than a century, mathematicians have sought to understand a vast, 248- 
dimensional entity, known to them only as Eg. Finally, in 2007, an international team 
of mathematicians and computer scientists made use of a supercomputer to tame the 
intricate beast. 

As background, consider the Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Sacred Mystery of 
the Cosmos) of Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), who was so enthralled with symmetry that 
he suggested the entire solar system and planetary orbits could be modeled by Platonic 
Solids, such as the cube and dodecahedron, nestled m each other forming layers as if in 
a gigantic crystalline onion. These kinds of Keplerian symmetries were limited in scope 
and number; however, symmetries that Kepler could have hardly imagined may indeed 
rule the universe. 

In the late nineteenth century, the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie 
(pronounced “Lee”) studied objects with smooth rotational symmetries, like the sphere 
or doughnut in our ordinary three-dimensional space. In three and higher dimensions, 
these kinds of symmetries are expressed by Lie groups. The German mathematician 
Wilhelm Killing suggested the existence of the Eg group in 1887. Simpler Lie groups 
control the shape of electron orbital and symmetries of subatomic quarks. Larger groups, 
like Eg, may someday hold the key to a unified theory of physics and help scientists 
understand string theory and gravity. 

Fokko du Cloux, a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist who was one of the 
Eg team members, wrote the software for the supercomputer and pondered the ramifica¬ 
tions of Eg while he was dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and breathing with a 
respirator. He died in November 2006, never living to see the end of the quest for Eg. 

On January 8,2007, a supercomputer computed the last entry in the table for Eg, 
which describes the symmetries of a 57-dimensional object that can be imagined as 
rotating in 248 ways without changing its appearance. The work is significant as an 
advance in mathematical knowledge and in the use of large-scale computing to solve 
profound mathematical problems.

Mathematical Universe Hypothesis 

Max Tegmark (b. 1967) 

In this book, we have encountered various geometries that have been thought to hold 
the keys to the universe. Johannes Kepler modeled the solar system with Platonic Solids 
such as the dodecahedron. Large Lie groups, like Eg, may someday help us create 
a unified theory of physics. Even Galileo in the seventeenth century suggested that 
“nature's great book is written in mathematical symbols.” In the 1960s, physicist Eugene 
Wigner was impressed with the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the 
natural sciences.” 

In 2007, Swedish-American cosmologist Max Tegmark published scientific and 
popular articles on the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that states that our 
physical reality is a mathematical structure and that our universe is not just described by 
mathematics—it is mathematics. Tegmark is a professor of physics at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute. 
He notes that when we consider equations like 1 + 1=2, the notations for the numbers 
are relatively unimportant when compared to the relationships that are being described. 
He believes that “we don’t invent mathematical structures—we discover them, and 
invent only the notation for describing them.” 

Tegmark’s hypothesis implies that "we all live in a gigantic mathematical object— 
one that is more elaborate than a dodecahedron, and probably also more complex than 
objects with intimidating names like Calabi-Yau manifolds, tensor bundles, and Hilbert 
spaces, which appear in today’s most advanced theories. Everything in our world is 
purely mathematical—including you.” If this idea seems counterintuitive, this shouldn’t 
be surprising, because many modem theories, like quantum theory and relativity, can 
defy intuition. As mathematician Ronald Graham once said, “Our brains have evolved 
to get us out of the rain, find where the berries are, and keep us from getting killed. 
Our brains did not evolve to help us grasp really large numbers or to look at things in a 
hundred thousand dimensions.”

that the manuscript in present-day form

sequence with a 0, as in 0, l, 1, 2, 3

Discovery of Series Formula for TT, 
c. 1500 

R Roy says that although the series for¬ 
mula appears in Tantrasangraha , “in the 
Aryabhatiyabhasya, a work on astronomy, 
Nilakantha attributes the series for sine to 
mathematician Madhava (1340-1425)” 

Roy, R , Math Mag 63 291,1990 

Golden Ratio, 1509 

The origin of the term golden ratio is 
disputed but appears to have emerged in 
the twelfth century Although the recent 
history of the golden ratio was triggered by 
Luca Pacioli's D ivina Proportione (1509), 
ancient Greek mathematicians studied the 
ratio much earlier because it frequently 
appeared in geometrical studies Note that 
the artistic figure for this entry depicts a 
Fibonacci spiral, based on consecutive 
terms of a Fibonacci sequence Because 
the ratios of consecutive terms in the 
Fibonacci series approach 0 , the two 
spirals are quite similar in appearance

Group Theory, 1832 
It would be incorrect to imply that all of 
group theory had come to Galois dunng 
his final night. I. Peterson writes, “In fact, 
Galois had been writing papers on the 
subject since the age of 17, and the new 
idea of‘group’ that he had introduced is 
found in all of them. Nonetheless, Galois 
did help create a field that would keep 
mathematicians busy for hundreds of 
years, but not in one night 1 ”

Lissajous curves were actually first studied

considered “harmonographs” given that 
harmonograph patterns depend on the

Penrose Tiles, 1973 
R Ammann independently discovered 
these kinds of tilings at approximately 
the same time as Penrose B Griinbaum 
and G Shephard wrote “in 1973 and 
1974 Roger Penrose discovered 3 sets of 
aperiodic prototiles ” For example, the 
first set, denoted by PI, consists of 6 tiles 
based on rhombs, regular pentagons, 
pentacles, and “half-pentacles,” with 
edges, modified by projections and 
indentations The second set of aperiodic 
tiles, denoted by P2, was discovered by 
Penrose in 1974 and contains only 2 tiles

Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, 
2007 

Tegmark’s theory was partly based on a 
talk given at the symposium “Multiverse 
and String Theoiy” held in 2005 at 
Stanford University. The seeds of his 
theory were planted in other papers in 
the late 1990s but reached full flower 
in 2007. Other researchers, such as K 
Zuse, E. Fredkin, and S. Wolfram have 
suggested that the physical universe may 
be running on a cellular automaton.

Because several of the ancient and rare documents shown in this book were difficult to acquire in a clean and legible 
form, 1 have sometimes taken the liberty to apply image-processing techniques to remove dirt and scratches, enhance 
faded portions, and occasionally add a slight coloration to a black-and-white document in order to highlight certain 
details or simply to make an image more compelling to look at 1 hope that historical purists will forgive these slight 
artistic touches and understand that my goal was to create an attractive book —rich in history and detail—that is both 
aesthetically interesting and alluring even to students and laypeople. My love for the incredible depth and diversity of 
mathematics, art, and history should be evident through the photographs and drawings exhibited throughout the book
